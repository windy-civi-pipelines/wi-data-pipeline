Referred to Committee on Mental Health and Substance Abuse Prevention.AB112,1,61An Act to amend 51.13 (1) (b), 51.13 (1) (c), 51.13 (3) (am), 51.13 (4) (a) (intro.), 251.13 (4) (a) 3., 51.13 (4) (d), 51.13 (4) (g) 1. b., 51.13 (6) (a) 2., 51.13 (7) (a), 351.13 (7) (b) 3., 51.13 (7) (b) 5., 51.13 (7) (c), 51.14 (3) (a), 51.14 (3) (f), 51.14 (3) 4(g), 51.14 (3) (h) (intro.), 51.14 (3) (j), 51.14 (4) (a), 51.14 (4) (g) (intro.) and 551.61 (6); to create 51.138 (1m) of the statutes; relating to: consent to mental 6health treatment by minors who are age 14 or older.Analysis by the Legislative Reference BureauThis bill is explained in the Notes provided by the Joint Legislative Council in the bill.The people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:Joint Legislative Council prefatory note: This bill was prepared for the Joint Legislative Council Study Committee on Emergency Detention and Civil Commitment of Minors.The bill revises requirements to obtain a minor’s consent for mental health services. Very briefly, the bill allows either a minor age 14 or older, or the minor’s parent or guardian, to consent to begin outpatient or inpatient mental health treatment for the minor. If a parent consented to treatment without the minor’s agreement, a petition must be filed for review of the appropriateness of the treatment.Current LawUnder current law, if a minor is age 14 or older, both the minor’s and the parent’s mutual consent are required for outpatient or inpatient mental health treatment. Very generally, if a minor or parent refuses to provide consent for treatment, the other party may petition for review and approval to begin outpatient or inpatient treatment.General Revision to Minor’s Consent for Mental Health TreatmentThe bill revises the provisions that require both a minor age 14 or older and the minor’s parent or guardian to consent to outpatient or inpatient mental health treatment, to instead specify that either a minor age 14 or older, or a parent or guardian, may consent to outpatient or inpatient mental health treatment. The bill does not alter mental health treatment consent provisions that apply when a minor is under age 14.Inpatient ProceduresThe bill specifies that if a minor age 14 or older refused to join an application for admission to an inpatient treatment facility for treatment of mental illness or developmental disability, the treatment facility director must notify the local county corporation counsel that the minor has been admitted to the facility. The county corporation counsel is then required to file a petition for court review of the admission in the manner provided under current law. Likewise, the bill specifies that if a parent or guardian refused to join an application for admission to an inpatient treatment facility for treatment of mental illness or developmental disability, the parent or guardian may file a petition for review of the admission in the manner provided under current law.Under current law, if the court finds that the therapy or treatment for mental illness or developmental disability in the inpatient facility to which the minor was admitted is not appropriate or is not the least restrictive therapy or treatment for the minor’s needs, the court may order that the minor be transferred to more appropriate therapy or treatment, if the transfer is first approved by both a minor age 14 or older and a parent or guardian. The bill allows the court to order a transfer to more appropriate therapy or treatment, if first approved by a minor age 14 or older, or the parent or guardian, rather than requiring approval of both the minor and the parent or guardian.The bill makes similar revisions to allow either a minor’s or the parent’s or guardian’s consent in the procedures for short-term admissions, continued admission if admission occurred when the minor was under age 14, and discharge upon written request.Outpatient ProceduresThe bill specifies that if a minor age 14 or older provided consent for outpatient mental health treatment, despite a parent’s or guardian’s refusal to consent, the parent or guardian may petition for review of the appropriateness of the outpatient mental health treatment by the court mental health review officer in the manner provided under current law. Likewise, the bill specifies that if a parent or guardian provided consent for outpatient mental health treatment, despite the minor’s refusal to consent, the outpatient treatment facility director must notify the local county corporation counsel that the minor is receiving outpatient mental health treatment at the facility. The county corporation counsel is then required to file a petition for review of the appropriateness of the outpatient mental health treatment by the court mental health review officer in the manner provided under current law.Additionally, under current law, outpatient mental health treatment may be provided to a minor in certain emergency situations without first obtaining a parent’s or guardian’s consent, if reasonable efforts have been made to obtain the parent’s or guardian’s consent before initiating treatment. The bill removes the requirement for a health care provider to make reasonable efforts to obtain a parent’s or guardian’s consent for outpatient mental health treatment for a minor age 14 or older in those emergency situations. Instead, under the bill, all outpatient mental health treatment, including emergency outpatient mental health treatment, is subject to the general outpatient procedures that apply when a minor is age 14 or older.AB112,11Section 1. 51.13 (1) (b) of the statutes is amended to read:AB112,2,9251.13 (1) (b) Minors 14 years of age or older; mental illness or developmental 3disability. The application for admission of a minor who is 14 years of age or older 4to an approved inpatient treatment facility for the primary purpose of treatment for 5mental illness or developmental disability shall be executed by the minor and, a 6parent who has legal custody of the minor, or the minor’s guardian, except as 7provided in par. (c). If the minor refuses to execute the application, a parent who 8has legal custody of the minor or the minor’s guardian may execute the application 9on the minor’s behalf, and the petition shall be filed as required under sub. (4).AB112,210Section 2. 51.13 (1) (c) of the statutes is amended to read:AB112,3,21151.13 (1) (c) Lack of parent or guardian consent to treatment. If a minor who 12is under 14 years of age wishes to be admitted to an approved inpatient treatment 13facility or a minor who is 14 years of age or older wishes to be admitted to an 14approved inpatient facility for the primary purpose of treatment for alcoholism or 15drug abuse but a parent with legal custody or the guardian cannot be found, there 16is no parent with legal custody or guardian, or the parent with legal custody or 17guardian of a the minor 14 years of age or older refuses to execute the application, 18the minor or a person acting on the minor’s behalf may petition the court under sub. 1(4).

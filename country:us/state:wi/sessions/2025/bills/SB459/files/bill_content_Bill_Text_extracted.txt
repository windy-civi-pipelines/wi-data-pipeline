Referred to Committee on Judiciary and Public Safety..SB459,1,21An Act to amend 907.02 (1) of the statutes; relating to: admissibility of 2expert witness testimony.Analysis by the Legislative Reference BureauThis bill updates the current statutory rule of evidence relating to testimony by experts to conform with recent changes made to Federal Rule of Evidence (FRE) 702 intended to clarify the court’s gatekeeping role with respect to expert testimony. Current law parallels FRE 702 prior to its amendment, allowing the testimony of an expert witness if the witness’s scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact at issue in the case, but limiting the testimony of an expert witness to testimony that is based on sufficient facts or data, that is the product of reliable principles and methods, and that is based on the witness applying those principles and methods reliably to the facts of the case. Similar to the changes made to FRE 702, the bill confirms that the proponent of the testimony is required to demonstrate to the court that it is more likely than not that the witness’s testimony is based upon sufficient facts or data, that it is the product of reliable principles and methods, and, finally, that the witness’s opinion reflects a reliable application of those principles and methods to the facts of the case.The people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:SB459,11Section 1. 907.02 (1) of the statutes is amended to read:SB459,2,92907.02 (1) If scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist 3the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness 4qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education, may 5testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise, if the proponent demonstrates 6to the court that it is more likely than not that the testimony is based upon 7sufficient facts or data, the testimony is the product of reliable principles and 8methods, and the witness has applied witness’s opinion reflects a reliable 9application of the principles and methods reliably to the facts of the case.SB459,210Section 2.

This bill does not require the use of a smoke evacuation system if the health care provider who is engaging in the surgical procedure that is likely to generate surgical smoke concludes that using a smoke evacuation system in the operating room during the surgical procedure is not necessary or advisable under the circumstances.

A smoke evacuation system is equipment that effectively captures and filters surgical smoke at the site of origin before the smoke makes contact with the eyes or respiratory tract of occupants in the room.For further information see the state fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.The people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:SB442,11Section 1. 50.36 (1r) of the statutes is created to read:SB442,2,2250.36 (1r) (a) In this subsection:SB442,2,431. “Operating room” means a room used for the performance of surgical 4procedures requiring one or more incisions.SB442,2,752. “Smoke evacuation system” means equipment that effectively captures and 6filters surgical smoke at the site of origin before the smoke makes contact with the 7eyes or the respiratory tract of occupants in the room.SB442,2,1083. “Surgical smoke” means the gaseous byproduct produced by energy-9generating devices including surgical plume, smoke plume, bio-aerosols, laser-10generated airborne contaminants, or lung-damaging dust.SB442,2,1511(b) Except as provided in par.

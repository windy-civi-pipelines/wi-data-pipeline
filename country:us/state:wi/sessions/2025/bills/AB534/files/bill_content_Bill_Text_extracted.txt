Prior law also authorized voter registration to take place at a private high school or a tribal school that operates high school grades if requested by the principal. This bill reinstates those provisions.Under the bill, the municipal clerk must notify the school board of each school district in which the municipality is located that high schools will be used for voter registration. The school board and the clerk then appoint at least one qualified voter at each high school to be a special school registration deputy. The bill allows students and staff to register at the school on any day that classes are regularly held. The deputies promptly forward the registration forms to the clerk, and the clerk adds qualified voters to the registration list. The clerk may reject a registration form, but the clerk must notify the registrant and inform the registrant of the reason for being rejected. Under the bill, a form completed by an individual who will be 18 years of age before the next election and who is otherwise qualified to vote must be filed in such a way so that the individual is automatically registered to vote when the individual is 18.Finally, the bill allows a principal of a private high school or tribal school that operates high school grades to request that the municipal clerk appoint a qualified voter at the school to be a special school registration deputy. Under the bill, the clerk must appoint a special school registration deputy if the clerk determines that the private high school or tribal school has a substantial number of students residing in the municipality.For further information see the local fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.The people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:AB534,11Section 1. 6.28 (1) (b) of the statutes is amended to read:AB534,2,1126.28 (1) (b) All applications for registration corrections and additions may be 3made throughout the year at the office of the city board of election commissioners, 4at the office of the municipal clerk, at the office of the county clerk, or at other 5locations provided by the board of election commissioners or the common council in 6cities over 500,000 population or by either or both the municipal clerk, or the 7common council, village or town board in all other municipalities and may also be 8made during the school year at any high school by qualified persons under sub.

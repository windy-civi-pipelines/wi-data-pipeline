Uecker also made cameo and in-person appearances in productions such as The Tonight Show and Saturday Night Live; andWhereas, Uecker also appeared in a series of famous Miller Lite commercials during the 1980s, which became the source for one of his wittiest catchphrases—“I must be in the front row”—and inspired the term “Uecker seats” to describe upper-deck, obstructed-view seats in baseball stadiums; andWhereas, Uecker’s talent is widely recognized and honored with many awards: he was inducted into the Wisconsin Athletic Hall of Fame in 1998; he was inducted into the Radio Hall of Fame in 2001; he was honored by the Major League Baseball Hall of Fame with the Ford C.

Jacobson, Kreibich, Maxey, Murphy, Mursau, O'Connor, Piwowarczyk, Sortwell, Steffen, Wichgers and Tusler. Referred to Committee on Agriculture and Revenue.SB7,1,51An Act to renumber and amend 710.02 (1) and 710.02 (9); to amend 710.02 2(2) (intro.), 710.02 (3), 710.02 (5) (a) (intro.), 710.02 (5) (a) 1., 710.02 (5) (a) 2. 3and 710.02 (6); and to create 710.02 (1g), 710.02 (1r) (d) and 710.02 (9) (b) of 4the statutes; relating to: prohibiting a foreign adversary from acquiring 5agricultural or forestry land in this state.Analysis by the Legislative Reference BureauThis bill generally prohibits a foreign adversary from acquiring agricultural or forestry land in this state. In the bill, “foreign adversary” means a foreign government or nongovernment person determined by the federal secretary of commerce to have engaged in a long-term pattern or serious instances of conduct significantly adverse to the national security of the United States or security and safety of U.S. persons.Current law generally prohibits a nonresident alien or a corporation that is not created under federal law or the laws of any state (foreign person) from acquiring, owning, or holding more than 640 acres of land in this state. However, that prohibition does not apply to any of the following activities:1. An exploration mining lease and land used for certain mining and associated activities.2. Certain manufacturing activities.3. Certain mercantile activities.4. A lease for exploration or production of oil, gas, coal, shale, and related hydrocarbons, including by-products of the production, and land used in connection with the exploration or production.Those exceptions have been interpreted to be “extremely broad, embracing almost every conceivable business activity [other than a]ctivities relating to agriculture and forestry.” See Opinion of Wis. Att’y Gen., OAG 11-14, ¶5, available at https://www.doj.state.wi.us. In other words, under current law, a foreign person may acquire, own, and hold unlimited amounts of land for most nonagricultural and nonforestry purposes, but a foreign person may not acquire, own, or hold more than 640 acres of land for agricultural or forestry purposes.The bill retains the current law restriction on foreign person ownership of agricultural and forestry land and adds a provision that prohibits a foreign adversary from acquiring any land for agricultural or forestry purposes.The people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:SB7,11Section 1. 710.02 (1) of the statutes is renumbered 710.02 (1r) and amended 2to read:SB7,2,63710.02 (1r) Limitation.

Referred to Committee on Transportation and Local Government.SB393,1,31An Act to amend 343.16 (5) (b) and 343.20 (1) (c); to create 343.12 (3m) and 2343.20 (1) (cm) of the statutes; relating to: school bus operation by drivers 3over 70 and drivers with medical conditions.Analysis by the Legislative Reference BureauUnder current law, a person may not operate a school bus unless the Department of Transportation has issued a school bus or “S” endorsement to their operator’s license. A person must meet several requirements to be issued an “S” endorsement, including meeting certain physical standards, and a person’s “S” endorsement can be canceled for medical reasons. A person whose “S” endorsement has been canceled can apply to reinstate the endorsement. The application is considered by a medical review board that makes a final recommendation to DOT. Under administrative rules promulgated by DOT, a review board may recommend that an exception be granted by DOT if the review board determines the person’s medical condition does not impair their ability to safely operate a school bus.This bill provides that a person whose “S” endorsement has been cancelled for medical reasons that would require a medical review board exception may reinstate the endorsement by providing DOT documentation prepared by a health care provider stating that the person is able to resume operating a school bus. When DOT receives the documentation, DOT must reinstate the person’s “S” endorsement, which remains valid unless the medical review board determines the reinstatement is improper.Under current law, review boards must consist of licensed physicians or optometrists, to be appointed by the secretary of transportation. The bill provides that physician assistants and advanced practice nurses are also eligible to be appointed to review boards. Under current law, DOT may, by rule, require any person who is issued an operator’s license that is valid for more than two years to demonstrate continuing qualifications to hold the license at two-year intervals. The bill authorizes DOT, by rule, to require testing in intervals of not less than two years. The bill also provides that DOT must require any person who is 70 years of age or older and holds an “S” endorsement to file a medical certification annually and demonstrate their continuing ability to hold a license at four-year intervals.The people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:SB393,11Section 1. 343.12 (3m) of the statutes is created to read:SB393,2,62343.12 (3m) (a) A person whose school bus endorsement is cancelled for 3medical reasons that would require a medical review board exception to allow the 4person to continue operating a school bus may reinstate their school bus 5endorsement by providing the department documentation prepared by a health 6care provider stating that the person is able to resume operating a school bus.

Health insurance policies are referred to in the statutes as disability insurance policies. Self-insured governmental health plans are also required to provide the coverage specified in the bill. The bill also requires coverage of those breast screenings by the Medical Assistance program, which is the state-administered Medicaid program that is jointly funded by the state and federal governments and that provides health services to individuals with limited financial resources.Under the bill, health insurance policies may not charge a cost-sharing amount for a supplemental breast screening examination or diagnostic breast examination. The limitation on cost-sharing does not apply to the extent that the limitation would result in ineligibility for a health savings account under the federal Internal Revenue Code.Health insurance policies are required under current law to cover two mammographic breast examinations to screen for breast cancer for a woman from ages 45 to 49 if certain criteria are satisfied. Health insurance policies must currently cover annual mammograms for a woman once she attains the age of 50. The coverage required under current law is required whether or not the woman shows any symptoms of breast cancer and may be subject to only the same exclusions and limitations, including cost sharing, that apply to other radiological examinations under the policy. The bill does not change or eliminate the current coverage requirements for mammograms, except that preferred provider plans are explicitly included in the current law and the bill’s requirements.This proposal may contain a health insurance mandate requiring a social and financial impact report under s. 601.423, stats.For further information see the state fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.The people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:SB264,11Section 1. 40.51 (8m) of the statutes is amended to read:SB264,2,5240.51 (8m) Every health care coverage plan offered by the group insurance 3board under sub.

Referred to Committee on State Affairs.AB254,1,41An Act to renumber 182.71 (1) (a); to amend 182.71 (5) (b), 182.71 (5) (c), 2182.71 (5) (f), 182.71 (6) (intro.), 182.71 (6) (a), 182.71 (6) (f), 182.71 (7) (c), 3182.71 (7) (d) and 182.71 (8); to create 182.71 (1) (ag) of the statutes; relating 4to: regulation of the Chippewa and Flambeau Improvement Company.Analysis by the Legislative Reference BureauCurrent law requires the Chippewa and Flambeau Improvement Company to produce as nearly as practicable a uniform flow of water on certain rivers by storing in reservoirs surplus water for discharge when the water supply is low, to improve the usefulness of the rivers and to reduce flood damage. To do so, the company may construct, maintain, or operate reservoirs, dams, and other improvements located along certain rivers and their tributaries, divert flood waters, and deepen or otherwise improve tributaries to improve navigation. If the company operates water reservoirs meeting certain requirements, the company may charge tolls to the operators of water power located on certain rivers or tributaries below the reservoir and benefitted by the reservoir. The Public Service Commission determines the amount of these tolls based on certain criteria and provides notice to each water power operator to be charged with tolls.This bill makes the following changes regarding the Chippewa and Flambeau Improvement Company:1. Allows tolls to be levied and used to pay for acquisition and improvement of the company’s reservoir system. Current law prohibits levying and using tolls for those purposes and prohibits tolls from exceeding the reasonable costs of operation and maintenance, including rent paid for leased properties, and a net annual return of 6 percent on capital invested in the company, including the par value of negotiable bonds issued by the company.2. Allows tolls to be levied to recover the costs of taxes and depreciation and to provide a reasonable allowance for working capital.3. Makes a water power operator that operates for at least two months of a six-month toll period subject to tolls for the entire six-month toll period. Under current law, such a water power operator is not subject to tolls for the entire six-month toll period.4. Eliminates the restriction under current law that restricts negotiable interest-bearing bonds issued by the company from funding no more than half of the cost of acquiring dams, reservoirs, and rights.5. Eliminates the prohibition under current law against the company from paying dividends to its stockholders while any of its bonds are outstanding, and also eliminates the current law requirement that if any company bonds are outstanding, subject to PSC approval, the earnings of the capital stock must be invested in a sinking fund to retire the outstanding bonds.The people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:AB254,11Section 1. 182.71 (1) (a) of the statutes is renumbered 182.71 (1) (ar).AB254,22Section 2. 182.71 (1) (ag) of the statutes is created to read:AB254,2,43182.71 (1) (ag) “Capital invested” means capital actually paid in and the par 4value of all negotiable bonds or other obligations issued by the company.AB254,35Section 3. 182.71 (5) (b) of the statutes is amended to read:AB254,3,46182.71 (5) (b) If the company operates water reservoirs under this section 7capable of storing and discharging 1.5 billion cubic feet of water that would not be 8naturally stored, it may charge uniform tolls to the owners, lessees or operators of 9every improved and operated water power located upon the Chippewa or Flambeau 10rivers or any of their tributaries below any of these reservoirs and benefited by the 11operation of these reservoirs. The sum of the tolls may not exceed the reasonable 12costs of operation and maintenance including taxes, depreciation, and rent paid for 1leased properties and, plus a net annual return on the cash capital actually paid in 2on the stock subscriptions to the company and on the par value of all negotiable 3bonds issued by the company capital invested and a reasonable allowance for 4working capital.

The company shall employ hydraulic engineers, selected by the commission, 12to assist the company and the commission in determining the tolls to be charged. 13The expense of employing the engineers shall be a part of the cost of maintenance 14and operation of the works.AB254,515Section 5. 182.71 (5) (f) of the statutes is amended to read:AB254,3,2016182.71 (5) (f) No tolls shall be levied or used to pay for any part of the original 17acquisition or improvement of the reservoir system. The tolls shall be a lien on the 18water power, dam, franchises and flowage rights of the person or corporation 19charged with the tolls.

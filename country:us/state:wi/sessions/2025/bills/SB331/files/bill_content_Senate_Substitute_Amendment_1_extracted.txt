The bill prohibits a person from operating an ATV or UTV in any careless, reckless, or negligent manner so as to impair the life, person, or property of another. Under the bill, for a violation of this prohibition that results in impairment of the property of another, the court may hold the defendant liable for treble damages, to be recovered by the person responsible for maintenance of the property, and may order the defendant to restore, rebuild, repair, or replace the property.ATV, UTV, and OHM operation on a bridge or culvertUnder current law generally, a person may not operate an ATV, UTV, or OHM on a highway. However, a person may operate an ATV, UTV, or OHM on the shoulder or roadway of a highway to cross a bridge that is no more than 1,000 feet long if the operation complies with a local ordinance that applies to the bridge. The bill eliminates the 1,000-foot limitation. The bill also provides that a person may operate an ATV or UTV on the shoulder or roadway of a highway to cross a culvert.Equipment required on ATVs and UTVsCurrent law requires ATVs and UTVs to be equipped with a headlamp and a tail lamp.

The bill also requires all required lights to be in working condition and prohibits operation of an ATV or UTV unless required headlamps and tail lamps are lighted. Current law also requires ATVs and UTVs to be equipped with a brake operated either by hand or by foot. The bill specifies that the brake must be functioning.Duty to render aidThe bill provides that the operator of an ATV or UTV involved in an accident must render aid to other persons involved in the accident and provide their name, address, and ATV or UTV information to any person injured in the accident and to any owner of property damaged in the accident.Emergency operation of ATVs and UTVsThe bill provides that ATVs and UTVs may be operated on any roadway if the operation is for emergency purposes during a period of emergency declared by the governmental agency having jurisdiction over the roadway.Authorized emergency vehiclesUnder current law, “authorized emergency vehicle” is defined to include vehicles operated by various entities, such as law enforcement officers, fire departments, conservation wardens, and ambulance services. The bill expands the definition of “authorized emergency vehicle” to include ATVs, UTVs, and snowmobiles operated by these same entities and to include OHMs operated by law enforcement officers and conservation wardens.Patrol vehiclesThe bill creates definitions for “patrol all-terrain vehicle,” “patrol utility terrain vehicle,” “patrol off-highway motorcycle,” and “patrol snowmobile,” which are ATVs, UTVs, OHMs, and snowmobiles that are owned or leased by a city, village, town, county, state agency, federal agency, federally recognized American Indian tribe, or public safety corporation, used for law enforcement, fire fighting, or emergency medical response, and equipped with required sirens and lights.

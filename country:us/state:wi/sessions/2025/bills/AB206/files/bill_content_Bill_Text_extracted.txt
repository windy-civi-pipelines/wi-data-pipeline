Jacobson, Knodl, Murphy, Mursau, Sinicki, Stubbs and Subeck, cosponsored by Senators Jagler, Feyen, Dassler-Alfheim, James, L. Johnson, Spreitzer, Testin and Wall. Referred to Committee on Health, Aging and Long-Term Care.AB206,1,41An Act to create 253.13 (6) of the statutes; relating to: the procedure for 2adding federal newborn screening recommendations to the state-required 3newborn screenings, granting rule-making authority, and providing an 4exemption from emergency rule procedures.Analysis by the Legislative Reference BureauIn general, under current law, newborns must be tested for certain congenital and metabolic disorders as specified in rules promulgated by the Department of Health Services. The federal Department of Health and Human Services maintains a list of disorders for which it recommends testing in newborns, known as the federal Recommended Uniform Screening Panel (RUSP).Under this bill, DHS must evaluate each disorder that is included in the RUSP as of January 1, 2025, to determine whether newborns in this state should be tested for that disorder. This requirement does not apply to any disorder in the RUSP if, as of January 1, 2025, the disorder is already included in the list of disorders for which newborns must be tested in this state. In addition, the bill requires DHS to evaluate any disorder added to the RUSP after January 1, 2025, to determine whether newborns in this state should be tested for that newly added disorder. If DHS determines newborns should not be tested for the disorder, DHS must annually review medical literature and the department’s capacity and resources to test for the disorder in order to determine whether to reevaluate the inclusion of the disorder in newborn testing in this state. If, in any of these evaluations or reevaluations, DHS determines that a disorder in the RUSP should be added to the list of disorders for which newborns must be tested in this state, the bill requires DHS to promulgate rules to add that disorder.The requirements for evaluations, reviews, and reevaluations under the bill do not apply to a disorder in the RUSP if DHS is in the process of adding, by rule, the disorder to the list of disorders for which newborns must be tested in this state. However, if the rule-making procedure for that disorder does not result in promulgation of a rule, then DHS must consider the disorder under the review and reevaluation procedures under the bill.For further information see the state fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.The people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:AB206,11Section 1. 253.13 (6) of the statutes is created to read:AB206,2,72253.13 (6) Federal recommendations; evaluation procedure.

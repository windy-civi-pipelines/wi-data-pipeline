Under this bill, a prosecutor must get the court’s approval to dismiss or amend a charge if the charge is for any of the following: 1) a crime of domestic abuse or a violation of a domestic violence temporary restraining order or injunction; 2) theft of an automobile; 3) a crime of abuse of an individual at risk or a violation of an individual-at-risk TRO or injunction; 4) first-degree, second-degree, or third-degree sexual assault; 5) a crime against a child; 6) illegal possession of a firearm if the person has been convicted of, adjudicated delinquent for, or found not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect of, committing, soliciting, conspiring, or attempting to commit a violent felony, as defined under current law; or 7) reckless driving that results in great bodily harm. The court may approve the dismissal or amendment of such a charge only if the court finds the action is consistent with the public’s interest in deterring the commission of these crimes and with the legislature’s intent, expressed in this bill, to vigorously prosecute individuals who commit these crimes. If the court approves any dismissal or amendment in a year, the court must submit an annual report to the legislature detailing each approval.Current law allows a prosecutor to enter into a deferred prosecution agreement with a defendant who is charged or may be charged with a crime. Generally, under a deferred prosecution agreement, the prosecutor agrees to dismiss a charge or not file a charge if the defendant complies with specified conditions. In addition, current law provides specific criteria for a deferred prosecution agreement if the defendant is or may be charged with child sexual abuse if the defendant is the parent of, the guardian of, a close relative of, or residing with the child; with a crime of domestic violence; or with a violation of a domestic violence TRO or injunction. Current law also prohibits a prosecutor from entering into a deferred prosecution agreement with a defendant who is charged or may be charged with operating a vehicle while under the influence of an intoxicant or a controlled substance, causing injury to another while operating a vehicle while under the influence, or homicide by intoxicated use of a vehicle. The bill prohibits a prosecutor from entering into a deferred prosecution agreement with a defendant if a complaint or information is filed that alleges the person committed any of the same crimes listed in items 1 to 7 above.The people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:AB66,11Section 1. 20.410 (1) (gL) of the statutes is amended to read:AB66,2,9220.410 (1) (gL) Global positioning system tracking devices for certain violators 3of restraining orders.

Jacobson, Joers, Kaufert, Kreibich, Maxey, Melotik, Mursau, O'Connor, Piwowarczyk, Prado, Sinicki, Snyder and Subeck, cosponsored by Senators James and Wanggaard. Referred to Committee on Education.AB362,1,31An Act to create 118.07 (6) of the statutes; relating to: requiring cardiac 2emergency response plans for cardiac emergencies that occur on school 3property or at school-sponsored athletic events.Analysis by the Legislative Reference BureauBeginning in the 2026-27 school year, this bill requires each school board and operator of a charter school to have in effect a cardiac emergency response plan (CERP) for cardiac emergencies that occur on school property and a CERP for cardiac emergencies that occur at school-sponsored athletic practices and competitions. Under the bill, a CERP is a written document that contains specific steps to reduce death from cardiac arrest in a specific setting. The bill also defines the core elements of a CERP, which include 1) a cardiac emergency response team, 2) a plan for activating the team in the event of a cardiac arrest, 3) distribution of the plan, 4) the incorporation of local emergency medical services into the plan, and 5) annual requirements to practice, review, and evaluate the plan.Under the bill, a CERP for a cardiac emergency that occurs on school property must address the use of school personnel to respond to a sudden cardiac arrest event that occurs on school property. This type of CERP must 1) include the core elements, 2) provide requirements for automated external defibrillator (AED) placement and maintenance, and 3) require training in first aid, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and AED usage for certain school personnel.Under the bill, a CERP for athletic events is required only if the school board or operator of a charter school operates the high school grades. A CERP for athletic events must address the use of coaches, athletic trainers, and other school personnel to respond to a sudden cardiac arrest event that occurs while an individual is attending or participating in a school-sponsored athletic practice or competition. This type of CERP must 1) include the core elements, 2) require that an AED is clearly marked and accessible in an unlocked location at each athletic venue during practices and competitions, and 3) require that each athletic coach employed by the school be certified in CPR and how to use an AED.The bill also requires a school board or operator of a charter school, when developing a CERP, to consider recommendations by the American Heart Association, Project ADAM, or another nationally recognized organization focused on emergency cardiovascular care.Finally, in the 2026-27 school year, the Office of School Safety in the Department of Justice may award grants for the purpose of assisting school boards and operators of charter schools to implement the CERPs required under the bill. The amount of a grant is based on the grade levels offered by the schools served by the CERPs. Under the bill, a school board or charter school is not required to comply with requirements in a CERP to place AEDs unless the OSS awards these grants.For further information see the state and local fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.The people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:AB362,11Section 1. 118.07 (6) of the statutes is created to read:AB362,2,22118.07 (6) (a) In this subsection:AB362,2,431. “Cardiac emergency response plan” means a written document that 4establishes specific steps to reduce death from cardiac arrest in a specific setting.AB362,2,552. “Core elements” means all of the following:AB362,2,66a.

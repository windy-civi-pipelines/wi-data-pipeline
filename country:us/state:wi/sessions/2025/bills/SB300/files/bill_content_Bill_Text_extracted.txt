Referred to Committee on Judiciary and Public Safety.SB300,1,51An Act to repeal 812.40, 812.405 and 812.42 (2) (b); to renumber and amend 2812.39 (2); to amend 812.33 (1), 812.35 (5), 812.35 (6), 812.38 (2), 812.39 (1), 3812.44 (3) and 812.44 (4); to create 812.35 (7), 812.39 (2) (b), 812.39 (2m) and 4812.395 of the statutes; relating to: eliminating the 13-week limit on the 5garnishment of earnings of certain debtors.Analysis by the Legislative Reference BureauThis bill eliminates the 13-week limit imposed on the garnishment of earnings of certain debtors. Under current law, a creditor may file a garnishment notice with a court and pay a fee to a garnishee for the purpose of collecting an unsatisfied judgment for money damages from earnings owed to the debtor by the garnishee. Current law limits the number of weeks in which the earnings of a debtor, other than a debtor who is an employee of the state or a political subdivision of the state, may be garnisheed to 13 weeks.Under current law, a court-ordered assignment of a debtor’s earnings for support or maintenance in a family law matter takes priority over an earnings garnishment. The bill provides that a court-ordered earnings garnishment to satisfy an order for restitution in a criminal matter takes priority over other earnings garnishments but does not have priority over an assignment in a family law matter.The bill makes various other changes, including changes to account for the increased length of time a garnishment may continue. For example, the bill requires a creditor to provide additional notices to a debtor when a garnishment extends beyond a 13-week period.The people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:SB300,11Section 1. 812.33 (1) of the statutes is amended to read:SB300,2,62812.33 (1) The creditor shall pay a $15 fee to the garnishee for each earnings 3garnishment or each stipulated extension of that earnings garnishment, except that 4there is no fee for a garnishment to satisfy an order for restitution under s. 973.20 5(1r).

If it is unlikely that the 11garnishee will become so obligated, the garnishee shall send a statement of that 12fact to the creditor by the end of the 7th business day after receiving the earnings 13garnishment form under sub. (3). The creditor shall send a copy of this statement 14to the court within 7 business days after receipt of the statement.SB300,315Section 3. 812.35 (6) of the statutes is amended to read:SB300,3,916812.35 (6) If the garnishee may become obligated to the debtor for earnings 17earned within pay periods beginning within 13 weeks after the date of service, but 18one or more earnings garnishments against the debtor have already been served on 1the garnishee and not terminated, the garnishee shall retain the earnings 2garnishment form and place the garnishment into effect the pay period after the 3last of any prior earnings garnishments terminates. The garnishee shall notify the 4debtor of the amount of the garnishment and shall notify the creditor of the amount 5owed on the pending garnishments by the end of the 7th business day after receipt 6of the garnishment form under sub. (3). If, before the earnings garnishment takes 7effect, the garnishee determines that it is unlikely that the garnishee will continue 8to be obligated to the debtor for earnings, the garnishee shall notify the creditor and 9court under sub.

If the creditor is notified of a different 17address of the debtor under this subsection, the creditor shall serve on the debtor at 18that address, by one of the means listed under sub. (3) (a) 1. to 3., copies of the 19information required to be served under subs.

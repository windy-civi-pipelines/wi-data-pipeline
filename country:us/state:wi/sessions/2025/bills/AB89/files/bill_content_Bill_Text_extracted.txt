The penalty for the crime would be determined by the aggregated value of the items taken.Because this bill creates a new crime or revises a penalty for an existing crime, the Joint Review Committee on Criminal Penalties may be requested to prepare a report.For further information see the state and local fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.The people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:AB89,11Section 1. 943.20 (5) of the statutes is created to read:AB89,2,42943.20 (5) Aggregation of values.

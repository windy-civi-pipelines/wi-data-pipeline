Current law also allows appointment of a GAL for a minor child if legal custody or physical placement is stipulated to be with any person or agency other than a parent of the child or, if at the time of the action, the child is in the legal custody of or physically placed with a person or agency other than the child’s parent.For further information see the state and local fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.The people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:SB522,11Section 1. 767.407 (1) (bm) of the statutes is created to read:SB522,2,52767.407 (1) (bm) In any action affecting the family where a petition has been 3filed for reasonable visitation rights under s. 767.43, the court may appoint a 4guardian ad litem for a minor child.

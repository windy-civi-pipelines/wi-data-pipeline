Under current law, if the battery is a special circumstance battery—for example, the battery is committed against an individual because of the individual’s status as a law enforcement officer, witness in a trial, or juror—the penalty is increased to a Class H felony. Under this bill, a threat or battery against a juror or a threat or battery against a family member of a juror is a Class H felony.Current law also allows a judge, upon sentencing a person for a crime, to prohibit the person from contacting a victim of or witness to the person’s crime during any part of the person’s sentence or probation. The bill allows a judge to prohibit a person who is convicted of a crime from contacting, for any part of the person’s sentence or probation, a juror who served at any proceeding related to the person’s crime.Because this bill creates a new crime or revises a penalty for an existing crime, the Joint Review Committee on Criminal Penalties may be requested to prepare a report.The people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:SB5,11Section 1. 48.685 (2) (bb) of the statutes is amended to read:SB5,3,2248.685 (2) (bb) If information obtained under par.

Referred to Committee on Judiciary and Public Safety.SB5,1,71An Act to renumber and amend 940.20 (3) (title) and 940.20 (3); to amend 248.685 (2) (bb), 48.685 (5) (bm) 4., 48.686 (1) (c) 9., 48.686 (1) (c) 12., 48.686 (2) 3(bb), 50.065 (2) (bb), 165.70 (1) (b), 165.84 (7) (ab) 2., 301.048 (2) (bm) 1. a., 4767.461 (4), 940.03, 941.29 (1g) (a), 941.291 (1) (b), 941.39 (title), 946.82 (4), 5949.03 (2), 968.26 (1b) (a) 2. a., 969.08 (10) (b), 973.049 (2) and 973.123 (1); to 6create 939.22 (21) (es), 940.202 (1) and (3) and 941.38 (1) (b) 5s. of the 7statutes; relating to: battery or threat to jurors and providing a penalty.Analysis by the Legislative Reference BureauUnder current law, the crime of battery is defined as intentionally causing another person bodily harm and is a Class A misdemeanor. Under current law, if the battery is a special circumstance battery—for example, the battery is committed against an individual because of the individual’s status as a law enforcement officer, witness in a trial, or juror—the penalty is increased to a Class H felony. Under this bill, a threat or battery against a juror or a threat or battery against a family member of a juror is a Class H felony.Current law also allows a judge, upon sentencing a person for a crime, to prohibit the person from contacting a victim of or witness to the person’s crime during any part of the person’s sentence or probation. The bill allows a judge to prohibit a person who is convicted of a crime from contacting, for any part of the person’s sentence or probation, a juror who served at any proceeding related to the person’s crime.Because this bill creates a new crime or revises a penalty for an existing crime, the Joint Review Committee on Criminal Penalties may be requested to prepare a report.The people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:SB5,11Section 1. 48.685 (2) (bb) of the statutes is amended to read:SB5,3,2248.685 (2) (bb) If information obtained under par.

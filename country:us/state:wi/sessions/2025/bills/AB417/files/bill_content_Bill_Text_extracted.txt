Under the bill, the district attorney may, at any time, regardless of whether criminal proceedings have commenced, apply to the circuit court for a waiver of the normal hearing requirement and for an emergency order to require the defendant to immediately submit to testing. Under the bill, the district attorney may make such an application only if the district attorney has probable cause to believe that waiving the hearing and expediting a defendant to submit to testing will prevent a public safety worker, prosecutor, or correctional staff member from experiencing bodily harm that could result from delaying the test. Under the bill, the court must immediately hear the application for an emergency order and grant the order if it finds that the existing requirements for such an order are met and also finds that waiving the hearing and expediting the defendant to submit to testing will prevent a public safety worker, prosecutor, or correctional staff member from experiencing bodily harm that could result from delaying the test.The bill also provides that if a defendant is found guilty of a crime for which the court has required the defendant to submit to communicable disease testing, the defendant must be required to pay, as restitution, the costs of any communicable disease testing that was ordered.For further information see the state fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.The people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:AB417,11Section 1. 146.81 (4) of the statutes is amended to read:AB417,3,82146.81 (4) “Patient health care records” means all records related to the 3health of a patient prepared by or under the supervision of a health care provider; 4and all records made by an ambulance service provider, as defined in s. 256.01 (3), 5an emergency medical services practitioner, as defined in s. 256.01 (5), or an 6emergency medical responder, as defined in s. 256.01 (4p), in administering 7emergency care procedures to and handling and transporting sick, disabled, or 8injured individuals. “Patient health care records” includes billing statements and 1invoices for treatment or services provided by a health care provider and includes 2health summary forms prepared under s. 302.388 (2). “Patient health care records” 3does not include those records subject to s. 51.30, reports collected under s. 69.186, 4records of tests administered under s. 252.15 (5g) or (5j), 343.305, 938.296 (4) or (5) 5or 968.38 (4) or, (5), or (6), records related to sales of pseudoephedrine products, as 6defined in s. 961.01 (20c), that are maintained by pharmacies under s. 961.235, 7fetal monitor tracings, as defined under s. 146.817 (1), or a pupil’s physical health 8records maintained by a school under s. 118.125.AB417,29Section 2. 252.11 (5m) of the statutes is amended to read:AB417,3,1510252.11 (5m) A health care professional, as defined in s. 968.38 (1) (a) (ar), 11acting under an order of a court under s. 938.296 (4) or 968.38 (4) may, without first 12obtaining informed consent to the testing, subject an individual to a test or a series 13of tests to ascertain whether that individual is infected with a sexually transmitted 14disease.

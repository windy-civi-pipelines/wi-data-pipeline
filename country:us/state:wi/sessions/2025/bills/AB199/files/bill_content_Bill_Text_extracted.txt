The Medical Assistance program is a joint state and federal program that provides health services to individuals who have limited financial resources. This bill directs DHS to change, for dates of service beginning with January 1, 2027, the current maximum reimbursement allowed under the Medical Assistance program for services provided under HCPCS code A0998, often referenced as “ambulance response and treatment, no transport,” from the current maximum allowable fee to a rate that matches the maximum allowable rate for reimbursement of services provided under HCPCS code A0429, often referenced with a description of “ambulance service, basic life support, emergency transport (bls-emergency).”Report on scope of practice changesThe bill requires the Emergency Medical Services Board, in consultation with DHS and the Technical College System Board, to annually submit a report to the legislature on state and national changes to the scope of practice of emergency medical responders, emergency medical services practitioners, or any equivalent practitioners in other jurisdictions and how those scope of practice changes may affect training for emergency medical responders and emergency medical services practitioners in this state.Expenditure restraint incentive programThe bill also excludes expenditures of amounts levied for fees apportioned to each municipality operating a joint fire department or joint emergency medical services district that are exempt from local levy limits from being considered in determining eligibility for an expenditure restraint incentive program payment. Under current law, a municipality is eligible to receive an expenditure restraint incentive program payment if its property tax levy is greater than 5 mills and if the annual increase in its municipal budget, subject to certain exceptions, is less than the sum of factors based on inflation and the increased value of property in the municipality as a result of new construction.For further information see the state and local fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.The people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:AB199,11Section 1. 79.05 (2) (c) of the statutes is amended to read:AB199,3,21279.05 (2) (c) Its municipal budget; exclusive of principal and interest on long-3term debt and exclusive of revenue sharing payments under s. 66.0305, payments of 4premiums under s. 66.0137 (5) (c) 1. and 1m., expenditures of amounts levied under 5s. 66.0602 (3) (h), revenues generated from a tax imposed under s. 77.701, payments 6received under s. 79.038, expenditures of payments due to the termination of a tax 7incremental district under s. 79.096 (3), recycling fee payments under s. 289.645, 8expenditures of grant payments under s. 16.297 (1m), unreimbursed expenses 1related to an emergency declared under s. 323.10, expenditures from moneys 2received pursuant to P.L. 111-5, grants received from the state or federal 3government for the purpose of providing law enforcement, fire protection, or 4emergency medical services, and expenditures made pursuant to a purchasing 5agreement with a school district whereby the municipality makes purchases on 6behalf of the school district; for the year of the statement under s. 79.015 increased 7over its municipal budget as adjusted under sub.

This bill expands that duty to require pharmacies to dispense any lawfully prescribed drug or device without delay. However, if any pharmacist at a pharmacy refuses to dispense a drug or device for reasons of conscience such that the pharmacy cannot fulfill the prescription order without delay, then the bill requires the pharmacy to transfer the prescription order to a different pharmacy, at the direction of the patient, that will dispense the prescribed drug or device without delay. The bill also specifies that a pharmacy may not dispense a lawfully prescribed drug or device if there is an absolute contraindication for the prescribed drug or device, rather than just a contraindication. Under the bill, “absolute contraindication” is defined to mean any condition present in a patient that makes a particular drug or device inadvisable under any circumstances.Further, the bill prohibits a pharmacy benefit manager from penalizing in any way a pharmacy or pharmacist from dispensing a prescribed drug or device that is prescribed for a use other than a use approved by the federal Food and Drug Administration if the prescribed drug or device is dispensed pursuant to a valid prescription order.For further information see the state fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.The people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:AB127,11Section 1. 50.36 (6) of the statutes is amended to read:AB127,2,5250.36 (6) If the department receives a credible complaint that a pharmacy 3located in a hospital has violated its duty to dispense contraceptive drugs and 4devices under s. 450.095 (2), the department shall refer the complaint to the 5department of safety and professional services.AB127,26Section 2. 450.095 (title) of the statutes is amended to read:AB127,2,77450.095 (title) Duty to dispense contraceptives.AB127,38Section 3. 450.095 (1) (a) of the statutes is repealed.AB127,49Section 4. 450.095 (1) (am) of the statutes is created to read:AB127,2,1310450.095 (1) (am) “Absolute contraindication” means any condition present in 11a patient that renders a particular drug or device not safe to be used as prescribed 12under any circumstance because of the severe or potentially life-threatening risks 13involved.AB127,514Section 5. 450.095 (2) (intro.) of the statutes is amended to read:AB127,3,415450.095 (2) (intro.)

Referred to Committee on Licensing, Regulatory Reform, State and Federal Affairs.SB589,1,21An Act to create 253.078 of the statutes; relating to: statutory right to 2contraception.Analysis by the Legislative Reference BureauThis bill establishes that a person has a statutory right to obtain contraceptives and to engage in contraception and, further, that a health care provider has a corresponding right to provide contraceptives, contraception, and contraception-related information. Under the bill, these rights may not be limited or otherwise infringed through any limitation or requirement that 1) expressly, effectively, implicitly, or as implemented singles out the provision of contraceptives, contraception, or contraception-related information; health care providers who provide contraceptives, contraception, or contraception-related information; or facilities in which contraceptives, contraception, or contraception-related information is provided; and 2) impedes access to contraceptives, contraception, or contraception-related information. The bill provides that a party may defend against a claim that a limitation or requirement violates the rights established under the bill by establishing, by clear and convincing evidence, both that the limitation or requirement significantly advances the safety of contraceptives, contraception, and contraception-related information and that the safety of contraceptives, contraception, and contraception-related information or the health of patients cannot be advanced by a less restrictive alternative measure or action.The bill specifically provides that neither the state nor any political subdivision of the state may administer, implement, or enforce any law, rule, regulation, standard, or other provision having the force and effect of law in a manner that 1) prohibits or restricts the sale, provision, or use of any contraceptives that have been approved by the federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for contraceptive purposes; 2) prohibits or restricts any person from aiding another person in obtaining any contraceptives approved by the FDA or contraceptive methods; or 3) exempts any contraceptives approved by the FDA from any other generally applicable law in a way that would make it more difficult to sell, provide, obtain, or use those contraceptives or contraceptive methods. The bill allows the attorney general on behalf of the state or any individual or entity, including any health care provider or patient, to bring a cause of action for a violation of the provisions of the bill.The people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:SB589,11Section 1. 253.078 of the statutes is created to read:SB589,2,32253.078 Right to contraception.

Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479 (1965), the U.S. Supreme Court 13first recognized the constitutional right for married people to use contraceptives.SB589,6,1614(d) In Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U.S. 438 (1972), the U.S. Supreme Court 15confirmed the constitutional right of all people to legally access contraceptives 16regardless of marital status.SB589,6,1817(e) In Carey v. Population Services International, 431 U.S. 678 (1977), the 18U.S. Supreme Court affirmed the constitutional right to contraceptives for minors.SB589,7,519(f) The right to contraceptives is protected by the Wisconsin Constitution. See 20article I, section 1, of the Wisconsin Constitution; Haase v. Sawicki, 20 Wis. 2d 308, 21310 n.2 (1963) (finding that article I, section 1, of the Wisconsin Constitution is 22substantially the equivalent of the Due Process Clause and the Equal Protection 23Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment); Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479, 484-2486 (1965) (finding that a prohibition on the use of contraceptives violates the right 1to privacy created by several fundamental constitutional guarantees under the U.S. 2Constitution); and Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U.S. 558, 573-74 (2003) (finding that the 3Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment protects personal decisions 4relating to marriage, procreation, contraception, family relationships, child rearing, 5and education).SB589,7,96(g) The right to contraception has been repeatedly recognized internationally 7as a human right. The United Nations Population Fund has published several 8reports outlining family planning as a basic human right that advances women’s 9health, economic empowerment, and equality.SB589,7,1210(h) Access to contraceptives is internationally recognized by the World Health 11Organization as advancing other human rights such as the right to life, liberty, 12expression, health, work, and education.SB589,7,1613(i) Contraception is safe, essential health care, and access to contraceptive 14products and services is central to people’s ability to participate equally in 15economic and social life. Contraception allows people to make decisions about their 16families and their lives.SB589,7,2017(j) Contraception is key to sexual and reproductive health. Contraception is 18critical to preventing unintended pregnancy, and many contraceptives are highly 19effective in preventing and treating a wide array of often severe medical conditions 20and decrease the risk of certain cancers.SB589,7,2321(k) Family planning improves health outcomes for women, their families, and 22their communities and reduces rates of maternal and infant mortality and 23morbidity.SB589,8,41(L) The United States has a long history of reproductive coercion, including 2the childbearing forced upon enslaved women, as well as the forced sterilization of 3Black women, Puerto Rican women, indigenous women, immigrant women, and 4disabled women, and reproductive coercion continues to occur.SB589,8,135(m) The right to make personal decisions about contraceptive use is important 6for all people, and is especially critical for historically marginalized groups, 7including Black, indigenous, and other people of color; immigrants; lesbian, gay, 8bisexual, transgender, and queer people; people with disabilities; people with low 9incomes; and people living in rural and underserved areas. Many people who are 10part of these marginalized groups already face barriers, exacerbated by social, 11political, economic, and environmental inequities, to comprehensive health care, 12including reproductive health care, that reduce their ability to make decisions 13about their health, families, and lives.SB589,8,1614(n) Policies governing pharmaceutical and insurance policies affect the 15accessibility of contraceptives and the settings in which contraception services are 16delivered.

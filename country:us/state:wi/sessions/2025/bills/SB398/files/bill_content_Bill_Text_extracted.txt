Johnson, Keyeski, Larson, Ratcliff, Spreitzer, Wirch and Dassler-Alfheim, cosponsored by Representatives Vining, Johnson, Stubbs, Anderson, Andraca, Bare, Brown, Clancy, DeSanto, DeSmidt, Emerson, Fitzgerald, Goodwin, Haywood, Hong, Joers, Kirsch, Madison, McCarville, Miresse, Moore Omokunde, Neubauer, Prado, Roe, Sinicki, Snodgrass, Taylor and Tenorio. Referred to Committee on Licensing, Regulatory Reform, State and Federal Affairs.SB398,1,61An Act to amend 71.05 (6) (a) 15., 71.10 (4) (i), 71.21 (4) (a), 71.26 (2) (a) 4., 271.30 (3) (f), 71.34 (1k) (g), 71.45 (2) (a) 10. and 71.49 (1) (f); to create 20.835 3(2) (de), 71.07 (8m), 71.28 (8m), 71.47 (8m) and 101.129 of the statutes; 4relating to: requiring universal changing stations in certain buildings, 5creating a tax credit for installation of the stations, and making an 6appropriation.Analysis by the Legislative Reference BureauThis bill requires that certain buildings include at least one single-occupant restroom with a “universal changing station,” which the bill defines as a floor-mounted or wall-mounted, powered, and height-adjustable adult changing table with a safety rail that can be used for personal hygiene by an individual with a disability of either sex and the individual’s care provider. The bill specifies other requirements that a universal changing station must satisfy, including requirements regarding size, maneuverability space, weight load, adjustability, and signage.The bill applies to certain buildings that are subject to the state’s commercial building code, which is administered by the Department of Safety and Professional Services. Specifically, the building must be one of the following: a place of exhibition or entertainment; a shopping center, shopping mall, or store of at least 40,000 square feet; a place of public display or collection, including a museum, library, or gallery; a place of recreation, including a building at a park, zoo, or amusement park; a place of education, including an elementary, secondary, undergraduate, or postgraduate private or public school; a social service center, including a senior center or homeless shelter; a state or local government building, including a building at a rest area; a public transportation station; or a professional office of a health care provider, hospital, or rehabilitation center.The bill’s applicability also depends on whether a building is a “high-capacity building,” which the bill defines as a building with the capacity to serve more than 3,000 persons per day. The bill requires any high-capacity building for which construction begins on or after July 1, 2026, to include at least one single-occupant restroom with a universal changing station. For any other high-capacity building, the building must have at least one single-occupant restroom with a universal changing station only if the building owner applies for a building permit for a project that satisfies each of the following: 1) the project alters, renovates, or makes an addition to the building; 2) the project has an estimated cost of $15,000 or more; and 3) the project does not involve solely a parking garage.For a building that is not a high-capacity building, the bill’s applicability depends on whether the building includes at least one single-occupant restroom before July 1, 2026. If so, the building must include at least one single-occupant restroom with a universal changing station if, on or after that date, the building owner applies for a building permit for a project described above. If a building does not include at least one single-occupant restroom before that date, and such a restroom is added to the building on or after that date, the building must include one single-occupant restroom with a universal changing station when the restroom is added.The bill also creates an income and franchise tax credit for small businesses that install universal changing stations. The credit applies beginning in tax year 2025. Under the bill, a small business is any entity that, during the preceding taxable year, either had gross receipts of no more than $1,000,000 or employed no more than 30 full-time employees. The credit is equal to 50 percent of the amount the small business paid to install the universal changing station, up to a maximum credit of $5,125. The credit may be claimed only if the universal changing station meets the requirements described above relating to such issues as size and weight load and the credit is refundable, which means that if the credit exceeds a claimant’s tax liability, the claimant will receive the difference as a refund.For further information see the state and local fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.The people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:SB398,11Section 1. 20.835 (2) (de) of the statutes is created to read:SB398,2,3220.835 (2) (de) Universal changing station credit.

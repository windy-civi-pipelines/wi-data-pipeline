Referred to Committee on Science, Technology, and AI.AB364,1,21An Act relating to: a virtual reality technology pilot program for school 2districts.Analysis by the Legislative Reference BureauThis bill requires the Department of Public Instruction to administer a pilot program to award a contract to an entity to provide a virtual reality technology program in one rural school district, one suburban school district, and one urban school district, each of which is selected by DPI. As part of the contract, the entity must agree to provide the virtual reality technology program to at least 16,000 pupils and provide at least 3,200 virtual reality headsets for use in the participating school districts. Under the bill, the virtual reality technology program must satisfy various criteria, including the following:1) It is aligned with the state model academic standards for math and science in grades 6 to 12.2) It has demonstrated significant improvement in Algebra 1 benchmark assessments through a research-backed, spatially enhanced approach to mathematical concepts, as verified by a third-party evaluation—specifically, a randomized, controlled trial.3) It includes a formative assessment platform that a) allows pupils to take assessments aligned with the state model academic standards for math and science and b) provides assessment results to teachers and school district administrators in a manner that allows them to monitor pupils’ progress toward meeting the math and science standards throughout the school year.The bill also requires DPI to provide to individuals who teach math in the middle or high school grades in the participating school districts coaching, which DPI must ensure is delivered in the classroom, and training on how to effectively use the virtual reality technology program in the classroom. Finally, the bill requires DPI to provide to the standing legislative committees on education monthly written reports on the status of the selection of an entity to provide the virtual reality technology program and the implementation of the virtual reality technology pilot program.For further information see the state fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.The people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:AB364,91341Section 9134.

It immerses pupils in real-world problems in the economy to build career 5exposure and relevance, utilizing 3-dimensional models and interactive models that 6visualize and manipulate abstract mathematical concepts that pupils typically 7struggle to grasp, retain, and apply.AB364,3,108d. It offers tactile, multimodal learning experiences that derive and teach 9math concepts and skills for science, technology, engineering, and math education 10in grades 6 to 12.AB364,3,1611e.

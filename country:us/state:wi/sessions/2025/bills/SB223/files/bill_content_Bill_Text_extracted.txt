The bill defines “gender identity” as an individual’s internal, deeply held knowledge or sense of their own gender, regardless of the individual’s sex assigned at birth or gender identifiers on official governmental documents, and “gender expression” as an individual’s gender-related appearance or behavior, or the perception of that appearance or behavior, regardless of whether it is stereotypically associated with the individual’s sex assigned at birth. The bill also make changes to various discrimination laws, including all of the following:1. Current law prohibits discrimination in employment, housing, and the equal enjoyment of a public place of accommodation or amusement on the basis of a person’s sex or sexual orientation. Current law also requires certain state agencies, authorities, and corporations to include provisions in contracts they execute obliging the contractor to similarly not discriminate against any employee or applicant for employment. The bill adds gender identity and gender expression as prohibited bases for discrimination in these areas.2. Current law prohibits the University of Wisconsin System, the Technical College System, public elementary and secondary schools, and charter schools from discriminating against a student on the basis of the student’s sex or sexual orientation. The bill prohibits the same educational institutions from discriminating against a student on the basis of the student’s gender identity or gender expression and from discriminating against a student based on the protected status of the student’s parent. The bill also prohibits the UW System Board of Regents from investing gifts, grants, and bequests in companies that practice discrimination based on sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression.3.

The bill allows only either a single individual or two individuals married to each other jointly to adopt a child and also provides that no otherwise qualified person may be denied the benefits of the adoption and guardianship statute subchapter because of the person’s sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression.5. Current law requires heads of executive departments and agencies to determine whether there is arbitrary discrimination on the basis of sex or sexual orientation and to take remedial action if such discrimination is found.

Current law provides that sex is a bona fide occupational qualification if all of the members of one sex are physically incapable of performing the essential duties required by a job or if the essence of the employer’s business operation would be undermined if employees were not hired exclusively from one sex. The bill adds to the sex as a bona fide occupational qualification law that an individual may not be treated or regarded inconsistent with the individual’s gender identity or discriminated against based on the individual’s gender identity or gender expression.11. Current law allows public places of accommodation or amusement to provide separate facilities to persons of different sexes.

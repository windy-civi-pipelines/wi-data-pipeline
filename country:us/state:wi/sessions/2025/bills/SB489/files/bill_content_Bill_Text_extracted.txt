Referred to Committee on Licensing, Regulatory Reform, State and Federal Affairs.SB489,1,51An Act to repeal 440.03 (14) (a) 1.; to amend 15.08 (1m) (b), 440.03 (13) (b) 239., 440.03 (14) (b), 440.03 (14) (c), 440.03 (14) (d), 440.08 (2) (a) 67v., 440.08 3(2) (a) 67x. and 457.02 (6) (b) 1.; to create 15.405 (18), 440.08 (2) (a) 47b. and 4chapter 467 of the statutes; relating to: music therapists, the practice of 5music therapy, and providing a penalty.Analysis by the Legislative Reference BureauCurrent law provides for the registration of music therapists by the Department of Safety and Professional Services, as well as dance and art therapists. This bill does all of the following with respect to the practice of music therapy and music therapists:1. The bill eliminates the music therapist registration credential in favor of a music therapist license. The bill specifically requires proof of current board certification as a music therapist by the Certification Board for Music Therapists as a license qualification and requires a bachelor’s degree or higher in music therapy, or its equivalent.2. The bill creates the Music Therapy Examining Board and transfers licensure of music therapists from DSPS to the board.3. The bill defines the practice of music therapy and prohibits the practice of music therapy, or the use of music therapist titles, without a music therapy license.4. The bill establishes a number of practice requirements and prohibitions for music therapists, including ones that address the involvement of health care professionals.5. Current law allows DSPS to grant an additional license to practice psychotherapy to an individual registered as a music, dance, or art therapist. The bill, which does not include the practice of psychotherapy within the defined scope of practice for music therapy, eliminates the ability for music therapists to obtain this separate psychotherapy license.The bill also raises the criminal penalty provision for music therapists from a fine of $200 or imprisonment for not more than six months, or both, to a fine of $10,000 or imprisonment for not more than nine months, or both.The bill does not affect the current law provisions regarding registration as a dance or art therapist.Because this bill creates a new crime or revises a penalty for an existing crime, the Joint Review Committee on Criminal Penalties may be requested to prepare a report.For further information see the state fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.The people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:SB489,11Section 1. 15.08 (1m) (b) of the statutes is amended to read:SB489,3,2215.08 (1m) (b) The public members of the chiropractic examining board, the 3dentistry examining board, the hearing and speech examining board, the medical 4examining board, the naturopathic medicine examining board, the physical therapy 5examining board, the perfusionists examining council, the respiratory care 6practitioners examining council, the board of nursing, the nursing home 7administrator examining board, the veterinary examining board, the optometry 8examining board, the pharmacy examining board, the marriage and family therapy, 9professional counseling, and social work examining board, the psychology 10examining board, and the radiography examining board, and the music therapy 1examining board shall not be engaged in any profession or occupation concerned 2with the delivery of physical or mental health care.SB489,23Section 2. 15.405 (18) of the statutes is created to read:SB489,3,8415.405 (18) Music therapy examining board.

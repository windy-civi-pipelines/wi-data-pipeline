The bill creates several exceptions to the ban, including exceptions for parking enforcement entities, controlling access to nonpublic areas, and the regulation of commercial vehicles. Under the bill, an entity using an automatic registration plate reader under an exception is limited to collecting only registration plate numbers; the date and time the data were captured and the location of the vehicle; and pictures of the plates, vehicles, and areas surrounding the vehicle. In addition, these entities must keep the data confidential and destroy the data within 90 days of collection.The bill prohibits a law enforcement agency from using the data from a privately owned security camera (such as a doorbell camera) or the data from an automatic registration plate reader without a search warrant unless there is an emergency involving danger of death or serious physical injury to a person and the data could prevent the death or injury or mitigate the injury. A law enforcement officer who violates the prohibition is guilty of a misdemeanor and subject to a fine not to exceed $10,000. The bill also creates a process for a law enforcement officer to obtain a search warrant for the data.Because this bill creates a new crime or revises a penalty for an existing crime, the Joint Review Committee on Criminal Penalties may be requested to prepare a report.The people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:AB576,11Section 1. 86.107 of the statutes is created to read:AB576,2,2286.107 Automatic registration plate reader ban.

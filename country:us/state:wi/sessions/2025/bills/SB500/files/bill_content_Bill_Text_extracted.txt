Referred to Committee on Government Operations, Labor and Economic Development.SB500,1,31An Act to repeal 108.04 (7) (t) 1.; to amend 108.04 (7) (e), 108.04 (7) (t) 2., 2108.04 (8) (d) (intro.) and 108.04 (8) (dm) of the statutes; relating to: various 3changes to the unemployment insurance law.Analysis by the Legislative Reference BureauThis bill makes various changes to the unemployment insurance law, as follows:Acceptance of suitable workUnder current law, if a claimant for UI benefits fails, without good cause, to accept suitable work when offered, the claimant is ineligible to receive benefits until he or she earns wages after the week in which the failure occurs equal to at least six times the claimant’s weekly UI benefit rate in covered employment. Current law specifies what is considered “suitable work” for purposes of these provisions, with different standards applying depending on whether six weeks have elapsed since the claimant became unemployed. Once six weeks have elapsed since the claimant became unemployed, the claimant is required to accept work that pays lower and involves a lower grade of skill.This bill modifies the provisions described above so that the claimant is not required to accept less favorable work until 10 weeks have elapsed since the claimant became unemployed.Quits due to nonsuitable workUnder current law, unless an exception applies, if a claimant for UI benefits quits his or her job, the claimant is generally ineligible to receive UI benefits until he or she qualifies through subsequent employment. Under one such exception, if a claimant quits his or her job and 1) accepted work that was not suitable work under the UI law or work that the claimant could have refused; and 2) terminated the work within 30 calendar days after starting the work, the claimant remains eligible to collect UI benefits. Under the bill, this exemption applies if the claimant terminated that work within 10 weeks after starting the work.Quits due to relocationsUnder current law, unless an exception applies, if an employee quits his or her job, the employee is generally ineligible to receive UI benefits until he or she qualifies through subsequent employment.Under one such exception, if the employee’s spouse is a member of the U.S. armed forces on active duty and is relocated, and the employee quits his or her job in order to relocate with his or her spouse, the employee remains eligible to collect UI benefits. This bill expands this exception so that it applies to an employee who quits employment in order to relocate with a spouse who is required by any employer, not just the U.S. armed forces, to relocate.For further information see the state and local fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.The people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:SB500,11Section 1. 108.04 (7) (e) of the statutes is amended to read:SB500,3,22108.04 (7) (e) Paragraph (a) does not apply if the department determines that 3the employee accepted work that the employee could have failed to accept under sub. 4(8) and terminated the work on the same grounds and within the first 30 calendar 5days 10 weeks after starting the work, or that the employee accepted work that the 6employee could have refused under sub.

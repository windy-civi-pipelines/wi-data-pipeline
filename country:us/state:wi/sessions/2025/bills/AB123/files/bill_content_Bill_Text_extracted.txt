Also under current law, during the pendency of an action affecting the family, parties are generally prohibited from relocating and establishing a residence with a minor child of the parties that is more than 100 miles from the residence of the other party, if the party does not have consent of the other party or an order of the court. The requirement to obtain a court order allowing relocation does not apply if the parents already live more than 100 miles apart when a parent proposes to relocate and reside with the child, but in that situation, the parent who intends to relocate with the child must serve written notice of the intent to relocate on the other parent at least 60 days before relocation.This bill adds an express requirement that the 100-mile distance for purposes of these provisions must be calculated as “driving miles,” defined in the bill to mean the actual distance traveling by road required to get from one location to another rather than the straight-line distance between those locations.The people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:AB123,11Section 1. 767.001 (1fm) of the statutes is created to read:AB123,2,32767.001 (1fm) “Driving miles” means the actual distance traveling by road 3required to get from one location to another.AB123,24Section 2. 767.117 (1) (c) of the statutes is amended to read:AB123,2,105767.117 (1) (c) Unless the action is one under s. 767.001 (1) (g) or (h), without 6the consent of the other party or an order of the court, relocating and establishing a 7residence with a minor child of the parties more than 100 driving miles from the 8residence of the other party, removing a minor child of the parties from the state for 9more than 90 consecutive days, or concealing a minor child of the parties from the 10other party.AB123,311Section 3. 767.215 (2) (j) 1. of the statutes is amended to read:AB123,2,1312767.215 (2) (j) 1.

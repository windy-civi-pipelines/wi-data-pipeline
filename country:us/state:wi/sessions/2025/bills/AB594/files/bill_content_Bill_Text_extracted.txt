The bill limits the amount of the deduction to $5,130 for the 2026 tax year, and the Department of Revenue must annually adjust the limit based on the rate of inflation. Under current federal and state law, a claimant may deduct up to $2,500 of qualified education loan interest paid per year, and the maximum deduction amount is phased down to zero as the claimant’s income rises to the annual income limit that is set under federal law.Because this bill relates to an exemption from state or local taxes, it may be referred to the Joint Survey Committee on Tax Exemptions for a report to be printed as an appendix to the bill.For further information see the state fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.The people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:AB594,11Section 1. 71.05 (6) (b) 57. of the statutes is created to read:AB594,2,5271.05 (6) (b) 57.

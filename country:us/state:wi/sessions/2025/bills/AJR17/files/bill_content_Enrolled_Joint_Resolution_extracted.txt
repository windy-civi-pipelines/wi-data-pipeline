andWhereas, the events of 1775 that began the revolution the year before independence was declared are significant moments that signaled the creation of a national identity and unity of purpose that transcended traditional geographic, cultural, and societal divides; andWhereas, individuals and communities across all the colonies came together to support their fellow countrymen; andWhereas, on the evening of April 18, 1775, with impending hostile action from the British army in Boston, Massachusetts, Paul Revere and William Dawes along with other alarm riders undertook a perilous ride to alert everyone in the countryside of the coming danger; andWhereas, preceding their departure from Boston, a prearranged signal was set in the Old North Church steeple to ensure that the message got out and did not solely rely on just one or two alarm riders; andWhereas, the two lanterns that were the signal were immortalized in Henry Wadsworth Longfellow’s poem Paul Revere’s Ride as “one if by land, and two if by sea” and have become an enduring symbol of American vigilance, perseverance, and preparedness in the face of adversity; andWhereas, those alarm riders and the citizens that answered the call to arms to serve and defend their fellow countrymen that night and the following day at the Battles of Lexington and Concord exemplify the spirit of community and shared responsibility that has defined our nation since its inception; andWhereas, we are reminded, 250 years later, that the call for unity and the call to serve each other is no less relevant today than it was then; andWhereas, a national initiative has been proposed by the staff of the Wisconsin Commission for the United States Semiquincentennial Commission that two lights be displayed in public spaces across the country for all to see, marking that significant anniversary in April 2025 and the beginning of the 250th anniversary commemorations leading up to the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence on July 4, 2026; andWhereas, state commissions, state governments, federal agencies, and community, heritage, and historical organizations across the country have eagerly endorsed the initiative, have pledged to support it and participate in it, and have encouraged others to do the same; andWhereas, some participating entities have also pledged to encourage a day of community service on April 19, 2025, as a way to encourage understanding about the true meaning of these historical commemorations, knowing that these events are not just marking history for history’s sake but rather encouraging reflection on the idea that all of these historic events were endeavoring toward one common goal: the chance for a better tomorrow, together; now, therefore, be itResolved by the assembly, the senate concurring, That the members of the Wisconsin Legislature do hereby proclaim the week of April 14, 2025, as Two Lights for Tomorrow Week and call on all citizens to unite in remembrance of our shared history, honoring the sacrifices made by those who fought for our independence and reminding ourselves of the values we hold dear today; and, be it furtherResolved, That the Wisconsin Legislature encourages all government buildings, community centers, public spaces, and citizens to take part in this symbolic display by prominently displaying two lights for all to see during the week of April 14, 2025, and to reflect on how those lights shining out in the darkness during this vigil symbolically illustrate our ongoing journey as a nation.Senator Mary FelzkowskiPresident of the SenateRepresentative Robin J.

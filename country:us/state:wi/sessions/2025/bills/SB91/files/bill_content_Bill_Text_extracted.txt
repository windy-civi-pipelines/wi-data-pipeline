This bill increases the penalty to a Class A felony if the crime involved at least three victims who were children at the time the crime was committed. A Class A felony carries a penalty of life imprisonment.Under current law, the court must impose a bifurcated sentence on a person who is being sentenced for a felony that was committed on or after December 31, 1999. A bifurcated sentence is a sentence that comprises a term of confinement in prison followed by a term of extended supervision in the community. Under current law, a court that sentences a person who has been convicted of a Class A felony committed on or after December 31, 1999, must determine one of the following: 1) the person is eligible for release to extended supervision after serving a 20-year term of confinement in prison; 2) the person is eligible for release to extended supervision on a certain date that is after the person serves a 20-year term of confinement in prison; or 3) the person is not eligible for release to extended supervision. Under this bill, a person is not eligible for release to extended supervision if the person is convicted of a Class A felony violation of trafficking a child.Because this bill creates a new crime or revises a penalty for an existing crime, the Joint Review Committee on Criminal Penalties may be requested to prepare a report.For further information see the state and local fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.The people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:SB91,11Section 1. 302.114 (1) of the statutes is amended to read:SB91,2,52302.114 (1) An inmate is subject to this section if he or she is serving a life 3sentence imposed under s. 973.014 (1g) (a) 1. or 2.

The provision required incumbent local exchange carriers (ILECs), to make basic voice service, defined as two-way voice communication service within a local calling area, available to all residential customers within the ILEC’s local exchange area. An ILEC is a telecommunications provider that resulted from the breakup of the Bell System pursuant to a federal antitrust action. The provision also required PSC to grant a waiver from this requirement when requested if in the public interest or if effective competition existed in the local exchange area. Current law sunsets these requirements after April 30, 2013.The people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:AB399,14Section 1. 196.203 (1g) (b) of the statutes is amended to read:AB399,2,71196.203 (1g) (b) An alternative telecommunications utility certified under 2this section pursuant to s. 196.50 (2) (j) 1. a. is subject to ss. s. 196.219 (2r) and 3196.503, and, with respect only to wholesale telecommunications services, is subject 4to ss. 196.03 (1) and (6), 196.219 (4), 196.28, and 196.37; and, if such an alternative 5telecommunications utility was regulated as a price-regulated telecommunications 6utility prior to June 9, 2011, the alternative telecommunications utility’s intrastate 7dedicated access rates shall mirror its interstate dedicated access rates.AB399,28Section 2. 196.50 (2) (j) 1. b. of the statutes is amended to read:AB399,3,119196.50 (2) (j) 1. b.

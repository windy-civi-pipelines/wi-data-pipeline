This bill changes the distinguishing date in those circumstances from the fixed date in 1907 to instead allow expanded authority to inspect or disclose information contained in or copy a vital record if the event that is the subject of the record took place at least 100 years ago. More specifically, the authority to issue, copy, or allow inspection or disclosure of information contained in a vital record specified under current law based on whether the event that is the subject of the record occurred before or after October 1, 1907, would, under the bill, instead be triggered by whether the event took place before or on or after January 1 of the year that is 100 years prior to the date of the request or, in the case of certain photocopies, the date of the issuance of the uncertified copy of the vital record—a date that will automatically advance as time progresses.For further information see the state and local fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.The people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:AB90,11Section 1. 69.20 (2) (b) of the statutes is amended to read:AB90,2,9269.20 (2) (b) Except as provided under sub.

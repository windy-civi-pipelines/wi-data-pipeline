A person who violates this prohibition is guilty of a Class A misdemeanor for a first offense and a Class I felony for a subsequent offense. This prohibition replaces the current law that penalizes a person who recklessly stores or leaves a loaded firearm within reach of a child who is under 14 if the child obtains it and does one of the following: 1) discharges the firearm and causes bodily harm or death (Class A misdemeanor); or 2) possesses or exhibits the firearm in a public place or endangers public safety (Class C misdemeanor).Because this bill creates a new crime or revises a penalty for an existing crime, the Joint Review Committee on Criminal Penalties may be requested to prepare a report.The people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:SB368,11Section 1. 948.55 of the statutes is repealed and recreated to read:SB368,2,72948.55 Storage of firearm if children present.

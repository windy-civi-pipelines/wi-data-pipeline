Referred to Committee on Criminal Justice and Public Safety.AB55,1,71An Act to repeal 175.60 (7) (d) and 175.60 (15) (b) 4. (intro.) and b.; to 2renumber and amend 175.60 (7) (c), 175.60 (15) (b) 4. a., 948.605 (2) (a) and 3948.605 (2) (b) 1r.; to amend 20.455 (2) (gr), 175.60 (2g) (a) and 175.60 (5) (a) 46.; to create 175.60 (7) (cm) (intro.) and 2., 175.60 (15) (b) 3. (intro.) and b., 5948.605 (1) (aj) and 948.605 (2) (bm) 1. of the statutes; relating to: possession 6of a firearm on school grounds by school employees and fees for licenses to 7carry a concealed weapon.Analysis by the Legislative Reference BureauBoth federal law and state law prohibit a person from possessing a firearm on the grounds of a school. Federal and state law provide several identical exceptions to the prohibition, such as for law enforcement and for persons in accordance with a contract between the person and the school. Federal law provides another exception for a person who is licensed to possess a firearm by the state if the state requires a background check to ensure the person is qualified for the license. Since the Department of Justice requires a background check before it issues a person a license to carry a concealed weapon, a licensee is allowed under federal law to possess a firearm on the grounds of a school. State law, however, does not provide an identical exception, so a licensee is prohibited under state law from possessing a firearm on the grounds of a school.This bill creates a state exception that is similar to the federal exception. Under the bill, a person who has a license issued by DOJ may possess a firearm on the grounds of a school if the person is employed by the school and the school board or governing entity has adopted a policy that allows employees who are licensees to possess a firearm.Under current law, a person who applies to DOJ for a license to carry a concealed weapon must pay an application fee and a person who is renewing a license must pay a renewal fee. DOJ must set the fee amount on the basis of the cost it incurs in licensing, but the fee can be no more than $37 for an initial license and $12 for a license renewal. In addition, the person must pay for a background check for each initial application and renewal application; that fee amount is currently $10. The bill waives the initial application fee, renewal fee, and background check fee for teachers who apply for a license.For further information see the state and local fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.The people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:AB55,11Section 1. 20.455 (2) (gr) of the statutes is amended to read:AB55,2,5220.455 (2) (gr) Handgun purchaser record check; checks for licenses or 3certifications to carry concealed weapons.

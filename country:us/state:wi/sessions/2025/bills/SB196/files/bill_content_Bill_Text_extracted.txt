Jacobson, Behnke, Dittrich, Duchow, Green, Gundrum, Murphy, O'Connor, Penterman and Wichgers. Referred to Committee on Government Operations, Labor and Economic Development.SB196,1,51An Act to renumber 108.04 (2) (ae); to renumber and amend 108.14 (19); to 2amend 108.04 (2) (a) 3., 108.04 (2) (bm), 108.04 (2) (g) 2., 108.04 (11) (cm), 3108.14 (21) and 108.22 (8) (a); to create 108.04 (1) (hg), 108.04 (2) (ae) 1., 4108.04 (2) (hL), 108.14 (19) (b) and 108.14 (28) of the statutes; relating to: 5various changes to the unemployment insurance law.Analysis by the Legislative Reference BureauThis bill makes various changes regarding the unemployment insurance (UI) law, which is administered by the Department of Workforce Development.Suitable work; work searchCurrent law requires that, as a condition of being eligible for UI benefits for a given week, a claimant must 1) be able to work and available for work; 2) register for work in the manner prescribed by DWD; and 3) conduct a reasonable search for suitable work. Separately, current law also makes a claimant ineligible for UI benefits if a claimant fails, without good cause, to accept suitable work when offered.The bill provides that an employer may report to DWD whenever 1) an individual declines a job interview or job offer; 2) an individual fails to respond to a job interview offer or job offer; 3) an individual cancels or fails to attend a scheduled job interview without attempting to reschedule the job interview; 4) a UI claimant is unavailable for, or unable to perform, work actually available within a given week; or 5) under certain circumstances, the employer recalls a former employee receiving UI benefits who fails to return to work. The bill requires DWD to consider these reports in determining claimants’ attachment to the labor market. The bill also provides that a UI claimant is not considered to have conducted a reasonable search for suitable work in a given week, and is therefore ineligible for benefits for that week, if the claimant declined a job interview, failed to respond to a job interview offer, or canceled or failed to attend a job interview in that week. The bill, however, provides that a report of a canceled or missed interview is to be disregarded if the claimant demonstrates that he or she promptly attempted to reschedule the interview and allows reports to be disregarded upon certain showings by a claimant. The bill requires a claimant to provide weekly verification of all job offers, job interview offers, recalls to return to work, and any other offers of work received or responded to by the claimant since the prior week’s verification, as further prescribed by DWD, and requires DWD to investigate reports from employers as needed to determine their effect on claimants’ eligibility for benefits. A disqualification of a claimant from receiving benefits for a given week based upon the claimant’s failure to conduct a reasonable search for suitable work does not reduce the claimant’s total UI benefit entitlement and does not preclude the claimant from receiving UI benefits in subsequent weeks, if the claimant is otherwise eligible for those weeks.The bill requires DWD to include information on reports submitted by employers under the bill in its annual UI fraud report made to the Council on Unemployment Insurance, including actions taken by DWD in response to the reports and their effect on claimants’ eligibility for benefits. In addition, the bill requires that this annual fraud report be submitted to the appropriate standing committees of the legislature.The bill requires DWD to have in effect methods to address any circumstances in which a claimant for UI benefits fails to return to work or to accept suitable work without good cause or is unavailable for work or unable to work, including reporting methods for employers and a notice from DWD to claimants about the laws governing such circumstances.Recovery of overpaymentsCurrent law allows DWD to act to recover overpayments in certain circumstances and allows overpayments to be required to be repaid in cases where an individual makes misrepresentations to obtain benefits in the name of another person. This bill makes such recoveries mandatory, instead of permissive.For further information see the state and local fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.The people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:SB196,11Section 1. 108.04 (1) (hg) of the statutes is created to read:SB196,2,32108.04 (1) (hg) 1.

An employee claiming benefits is unavailable for, or unable to perform, 11work actually available within a given week as described in par. (a).SB196,2,1312e. The employing unit recalls an employee who fails to return to work as 13described in sub. (8) (c).SB196,2,16142. The department shall investigate each report submitted under subd. 1. as 15needed to determine whether the report affects a claimant’s eligibility under sub. 16(2) (hL).SB196,217Section 2. 108.04 (2) (a) 3. of the statutes is amended to read:SB196,3,618108.04 (2) (a) 3. The claimant conducts a reasonable search for suitable work 19during that week and provides verification of that search to the department. The 20claimant’s verification under this subdivision shall include a record of all job offers, 21job interview offers, recalls to return to work, and any other offers of work received 22or responded to by the claimant since the prior week’s verification, as further 1prescribed by the department. The search for suitable work must include at least 4 2actions per week that constitute a reasonable search as prescribed by rule of the 3department. In addition, the department may, by rule, require a claimant to take 4more than 4 reasonable work search actions in any week. The department shall 5require a uniform number of reasonable work search actions for similar types of 6claimants.SB196,37Section 3. 108.04 (2) (ae) of the statutes is renumbered 108.04 (2) (ae) 2.SB196,48Section 4. 108.04 (2) (ae) 1. of the statutes is created to read:SB196,3,119108.04 (2) (ae) 1. In determining whether a claimant is available for work 10under par. (a) 1. and has maintained an attachment to the labor market, the 11department shall consider reports made by employing units under sub. (1) (hg).SB196,512Section 5. 108.04 (2) (bm) of the statutes is amended to read:SB196,3,2013108.04 (2) (bm) A claimant is ineligible to receive benefits for any week for 14which there is a determination that the claimant failed to comply with the 15registration for work and work search requirements under par. (a) 2. or 3. or failed 16to provide verification to the department that the claimant complied with those 17requirements, unless the department has waived those requirements under par. 18(b), (bb), or (bd) or s. 108.062 (10m). If the department has paid benefits to a 19claimant for any such week, the department may shall act to recover the 20overpayment under s. 108.22.SB196,621Section 6. 108.04 (2) (g) 2. of the statutes is amended to read:SB196,4,1922108.04 (2) (g) 2. If a claimant’s security credentials are used in the filing of an 23initial or continued claim for benefits or any other transaction, the individual using 24the security credentials is presumed to have been the claimant or the claimant’s 1authorized agent. This presumption may be rebutted by a preponderance of 2evidence showing that the claimant who created the security credentials or the 3claimant’s authorized agent was not the person who used the credentials in a given 4transaction. If a claimant uses an agent to engage in any transaction with the 5department using the claimant’s security credentials, the claimant is responsible 6for the actions of the agent. If a claimant who created security credentials or the 7claimant’s authorized agent divulges the credentials to another person, or fails to 8take adequate measures to protect the credentials from being divulged to an 9unauthorized person, and the department pays benefits to an unauthorized person 10because of the claimant’s action or inaction, the department may recover from the 11claimant the benefits that were paid to the unauthorized person shall, in the same 12manner as provided for overpayments to claimants under s. 108.22 or under s. 13108.245, act to recover from the claimant the benefits that were paid to the 14unauthorized person. If a claimant who created security credentials or the 15claimant’s authorized agent divulges the credentials to another person, or fails to 16take adequate measures to protect the credentials from being divulged to an 17unauthorized person, the department is not obligated to pursue recovery of, or to 18reimburse the claimant for, benefits payable to the claimant that were erroneously 19paid to another person.SB196,720Section 7. 108.04 (2) (hL) of the statutes is created to read:SB196,5,421108.04 (2) (hL) 1.

(a) 3. to conduct a reasonable search for suitable work for a 23given week and the department determines, based upon the claimant’s verification 1under par.

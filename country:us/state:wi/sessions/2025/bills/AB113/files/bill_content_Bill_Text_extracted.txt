The bill defines a safety plan as an individual’s written document, created in advance of a crisis, that provides guidance on how to help the individual when the individual experiences a behavioral or developmental health challenge or crisis.Safety Plan Contents and RequirementsA minor who is at risk of an encounter with law enforcement or other emergency service providers during a behavioral or developmental health challenge or crisis may create a safety plan with the assistance of a facilitator. The bill directs DHS to develop a standard safety plan template, and specifies that a minor’s safety plan may include any of the following information: the minor’s name and address or addresses; what it looks like when the minor feels unsafe or needs assistance; de-escalation strategies that work for the minor; contact information for the minor’s parent or guardian, health care providers, and individuals who can provide emotional support to the minor in times of crisis; what the minor would like law enforcement officers or emergency responders to know; and other information that is important to the minor.The bill specifies that a safety plan expires one year after the date the safety plan is signed.Release of InformationThe bill allows a minor’s safety plan to be shared with a safety plan partner only if the minor has signed a release of information stating that the minor agrees and understands that the safety plan will be used only to ensure the safety and well-being of the minor, may be revoked at any time other than during a crisis, will be shared in the portal and may be accessed by all safety plan partners and other networks in the portal, and that the release of information will be attached to the minor’s safety plan. The release of information must identify all current safety plan partners and include the minor’s acknowledgment that additional safety plan partners may join the network and access the minor’s safety plan. A facilitator must ensure that the minor understands the release of information.The bill specifies that a safety plan partner may access a safety plan only to ensure the safety and well-being of the minor during a crisis, to review or update a safety plan, or at the minor’s request. A safety plan partner must maintain confidentiality of a safety plan and may disclose a safety plan to a person who is not a safety plan partner in the network only if the person is the minor’s parent, guardian, legal custodian, Indian custodian, legal representative, another safety plan network during a crisis, or a bona fide researcher using de-identified information.Safety Plan NetworkThe bill authorizes two or more persons or entities to form a network with each other for the purpose of sharing safety plans for minors at risk of an encounter with law enforcement or other emergency service providers during a behavioral or developmental health challenge or crisis. The bill provides the following examples of persons or entities that may choose to form a safety plan network: systems of care through public or private entities that provide specialized services for children or that provide child welfare, juvenile justice, educational, or other identified services for children; a physical or mental health care provider; a county department of human services; a county department of social services; a school; a school district; a law enforcement agency; a fire department; an emergency medical services provider; a tribal agency; child welfare services in Milwaukee County; 911 dispatchers; and the 988 suicide and crisis lifeline.When a network is formed, the safety plan partners must enter into a formalized agreement that addresses the expectations for the safety plan partners, such as the safety plan partners’ obligations, training requirements, and roles in the network.Safety Plan Sharing PortalAs noted above, the bill requires DHS to develop and maintain a portal that is available throughout the state to facilitate sharing of safety plans among safety plan partners.

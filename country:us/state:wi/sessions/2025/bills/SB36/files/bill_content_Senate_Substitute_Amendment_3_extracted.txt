The bill uses the definition of “qualified tips” from the Internal Revenue Code, which generally defines qualified tips as cash or charged tips received by an individual in an occupation that traditionally and customarily received tips on or before December 31, 2024, as determined by the secretary of the U.S. Treasury Department.

To claim the subtraction under the bill, a claimant must include the claimant’s social security number on the claimant’s tax return, and if the claimant is considered married for federal tax purposes, the claimant must file a joint tax return. The subtraction under the bill is limited to $25,000 per tax year, except that the subtraction phases out to zero for unmarried claimants as modified federal adjusted gross income increases from $150,000 to $400,000, and the subtraction phases out to zero for married claimants as modified federal AGI increases from $300,000 to $550,000.

Referred to Committee on Children and Families.AB151,1,31An Act to amend 767.41 (4) (a) 2.; to create 767.41 (5) (am) 5m. of the statutes; 2relating to: a presumption that equalizing physical placement to the highest 3degree is in the child’s best interest.Analysis by the Legislative Reference BureauUnder current law, a court must set a physical placement schedule in an action affecting the family that allows a child to have regularly occurring, meaningful periods of physical placement and that maximizes the amount of time for a child with each parent and that is based on the best interest of the child. The Wisconsin Supreme Court in Landwehr v. Landwehr, 2006 WI 64, 291 Wis. 2d 49, 715 N.W.2d 180, has stated that this standard does not require equal placement for a child with both parents.This bill removes the current standard for determining a physical placement schedule and instead creates a presumption that equal placement of a child with both parents is in the child’s best interest. The presumption is rebutted if a court finds by a preponderance of the evidence, after considering all of the statutory best-interest factors, that equalizing physical placement time between parents would not be in a child’s best interest.The people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:AB151,11Section 1. 767.41 (4) (a) 2. of the statutes is amended to read:AB151,2,122767.41 (4) (a) 2.

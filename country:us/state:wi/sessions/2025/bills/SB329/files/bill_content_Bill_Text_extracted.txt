Johnson, Larson, Hesselbein, Roys, Drake, Keyeski, Smith, Ratcliff, Habush Sinykin, Carpenter, Dassler-Alfheim and Spreitzer, cosponsored by Representatives Andraca, Stubbs, Fitzgerald, Joers, Subeck, Vining, Kirsch, Bare, Brown, Sinicki, Roe, Hysell, Neubauer, Taylor, Snodgrass, Mayadev, Sheehan, Miresse, Udell, Arney, Emerson, Prado, Tenorio, Moore Omokunde, Palmeri, DeSmidt, Stroud, Anderson, Cruz, Goodwin, Johnson and Haywood. Referred to Committee on Licensing, Regulatory Reform, State and Federal Affairs.SB329,1,51An Act to amend 165.63 (3), 165.63 (4) (d), 175.35 (1) (at), 175.60 (9g) (a) 2., 2175.60 (11) (a) 2. f., 801.58 (2m), 813.06, 813.126 (1), 813.127, 813.128 (2g) (b) 3and 941.29 (1m) (f); to create 16.316, 20.505 (1) (ft), 801.50 (5sb) and 813.124 4of the statutes; relating to: extreme risk protection temporary restraining 5orders and injunctions, making an appropriation, and providing a penalty.Analysis by the Legislative Reference BureauUnder current law, a person is prohibited from possessing a firearm, and must surrender all firearms, if the person is subject to a domestic abuse injunction, a child abuse injunction, or, in certain cases, a harassment or an individuals-at-risk injunction. If a person surrenders a firearm because the person is subject to one of those injunctions, the firearm may not be returned to the person until a court determines that the injunction has been vacated or has expired and that the person is not otherwise prohibited from possessing a firearm. A person who is prohibited from possessing a firearm under such an injunction is guilty of a Class G felony for violating the prohibition.This bill creates an extreme risk protection temporary restraining order and injunction to prohibit a person from possessing a firearm. Under the bill, either a law enforcement officer or a family or household member of the person may file a petition with a court to request an extreme risk protection injunction. The petition must allege facts that show that the person is substantially likely to injure themself or another if the person possesses a firearm.Under the bill, the petitioner may request the court to consider first granting a temporary restraining order. If the petitioner requests a TRO, the petitioner must include evidence that there is an immediate and present danger that the person may injure themself or another if the person possesses a firearm and that waiting for the injunction hearing increases the immediate and present danger.If the petitioner requests a TRO, the court must hear the petition in an expedited manner. The judge must issue a TRO if, after questioning the petitioner and witnesses or relying on affidavits, the judge determines that it is substantially likely that the petition for an injunction will be granted and the judge finds good cause to believe there is an immediate and present danger that the person will injure themself or another if the person has a firearm and that waiting for the injunction hearing may increase the immediate and present danger. If the judge issues a TRO, the TRO is in effect until the injunction hearing, which must occur within 14 days of the TRO issuance. The TRO must require a law enforcement officer to personally serve the person with the order and to require the person to immediately surrender all firearms in their possession. If a law enforcement officer is unable to personally serve the person, then the TRO requires the person to surrender within 24 hours all firearms to a law enforcement officer or a firearms dealer and to provide the court a receipt indicating the surrender occurred.At the injunction hearing, the court may grant an extreme risk protection injunction ordering the person to refrain from possessing a firearm and, if the person was not subject to a TRO, to surrender all firearms he or she possesses if the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the person is substantially likely to injure themself or another if the person possesses a firearm. An extreme risk protection injunction is effective for up to one year and may be renewed. A person who is subject to an extreme risk protection injunction may petition to vacate the injunction. If a person surrenders a firearm because the person is subject to an extreme risk protection TRO or injunction, the firearm may not be returned to the person until a court determines that the TRO has expired or the injunction has been vacated or has expired and that the person is not otherwise prohibited from possessing a firearm.A person who possesses a firearm while subject to an extreme risk protection TRO or injunction is guilty of a Class G felony. In addition, a person who files a petition for an extreme risk protection injunction, knowing the information in the petition to be false, is guilty of the crime of false swearing, a Class H felony.The bill also requires the Department of Administration to award grants to law enforcement agencies for the purpose of training officers how to identify persons who are substantially likely to injure themselves or another if the person possesses a firearm and how to file a petition for an extreme risk protection TRO or injunction.Because this bill creates a new crime or revises a penalty for an existing crime, the Joint Review Committee on Criminal Penalties may be requested to prepare a report.For further information see the state and local fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.The people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:SB329,11Section 1. 16.316 of the statutes is created to read:SB329,2,7216.316 Grants for training law enforcement on extreme risk 3protection orders.

Significant changes include all of the following:Program name changeThe bill changes references in the statutes to “unemployment insurance” to “reemployment assistance” and requires the program and its benefits to be known as reemployment assistance. The bill also requires DWD to have a division known as the Division of Reemployment Assistance and requires the reemployment assistance law to be administered by that division.General qualifying requirementsUnder current law, a claimant for UI benefits is generally required to 1) register for work, 2) be able to work and available for work, and 3) conduct a work search for each week in order to remain eligible. A claimant is required to conduct at least four work search actions each week, and DWD may require, by rule, that an individual conduct more than four work search actions per week. Finally, if a claimant is claiming benefits for a week other than an initial week, the claimant must provide information or job application materials that are requested by DWD and participate in a public employment office workshop or training program or in similar reemployment services required by DWD.The bill does the following:1. Requires, for the third and subsequent weeks of a claimant’s benefit year, that at least two of the required weekly work search actions be direct contacts with potential employers.2. Requires a claimant who resides in this state, for each week other than an initial week, to submit and keep posted on the DWD’s job center website a current resume.3. Requires, when a claimant is claiming benefits with less than three weeks of benefits left, that the claimant complete a reemployment counseling session.Additionally, current law allows DWD to use information or job application materials described above to assess a claimant’s efforts, skills, and ability to find or obtain work and to develop a list of potential opportunities for a claimant to obtain suitable work. However, current law provides that a claimant who otherwise satisfies the required weekly work search requirement is not required to apply for any specific positions on the list of potential opportunities in order to satisfy the work search requirement. The bill requires, instead of allows, DWD to provide this assistance. The bill also repeals the language in current law providing that a claimant who otherwise satisfies the weekly work search requirement is not required to apply for specific positions provided by DWD and requires DWD to provide each claimant with at least four potential opportunities each week, one or more of which may be opportunities with a temporary help company.Finally, current law allows DWD to require a claimant to participate in a public employment office workshop or training program. The bill provides that DWD must require a claimant to participate in a public employment office workshop or training program if the claimant is likely to exhaust regular UI benefits. DWD may also require other claimants to participate in a public employment office workshop or training program, but must prioritize claimants more likely to have difficulty obtaining reemployment.Reemployment Services and Eligibility Assessment grantsUnder federal law, the United States Department of Labor (USDOL) operates the Reemployment Services and Eligibility Assessment (RESEA) program, whereby grants are awarded to states to provide reemployment services to claimants. Participation in the RESEA program is voluntary and requires that a state submit a state plan to USDOL that outlines how the state intends to conduct a program of reemployment services and eligibility assessments.The bill requires that DWD act to continue to participate in the RESEA program and requires DWD to provide certain RESEA services to all UI claimants.For further information see the state and local fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.The people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:SB197,11Section 1. 15.223 (2) of the statutes is created to read:SB197,2,3215.223 (2) Division of reemployment assistance.

Licensed athletic trainers must adhere to certain requirements under current law and as established by the Board. For example, current law provides that a licensed athletic trainer may only engage in athletic training in accordance with an evaluation and treatment protocol that is established by the athletic trainer in accordance with rules promulgated by the Board and recorded on a protocol form prescribed by the Board. An “athletic trainer” is an individual who engages in athletic training. “Athletic training” is defined to mean the provision of certain services primarily related to injuries or illnesses sustained while participating in “physical activity.” For example, “athletic training” includes “preventing, recognizing and evaluating injuries or illnesses sustained while participating in physical activity” and “managing and administering the initial treatment of injuries or illnesses sustained while participating in physical activity.”This bill amends the definition of “physical activity” for purposes of the licensing and regulation of athletic trainers. Under current law, “physical activity” is defined to mean “vigorous participation in exercise, sports, games, recreation, wellness, fitness, or employment activities.” The bill provides that “physical activity” is defined to mean “moderate or greater participation in exercise, sports, games, recreation, wellness, fitness, or employment activities.” The bill further provides that “moderate participation” is “activity that increases the participant’s heart rate and breathing rate but that does not make it difficult for the participant to hold a conversation.”For further information see the state fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.The people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:AB590,11Section 1. 448.95 (7) of the statutes is repealed and recreated to read:AB590,2,62448.95 (7) “Physical activity” means moderate or greater participation in 3exercise, sports, games, recreation, wellness, fitness, or employment activities.

Parker High School before being elected to the Janesville City Council in 1970; andWhereas, Tim served as ombudsman for U.S. Representative Les Aspin from 1971 to 1974; andWhereas, while serving as the people’s advocate, Tim bridged the gap between constituents of the First Congressional District and the decisions being made on their behalf in Washington, through making government more responsive and accessible, cutting through the red tape of an often distant and unresponsive bureaucracy, lending an ear to their issues and concerns, and giving a voice to the people of Wisconsin’s First Congressional District; andWhereas, in 1974, Tim ran for the Wisconsin State Senate as a Democrat, winning his election to represent the 15th State Senate District with more than 55 percent of the vote; andWhereas, Tim served from 1975 to 1987 in the Wisconsin State Senate—including as Senate Majority Leader from 1982 to 1986—and chaired committees relating to diverse issues including agriculture, labor, aging, transportation, business, and financial institutions; andWhereas, Tim’s first bill enacted into law ceded state lands to the City of Delavan for park and recreational purposes, and it was followed later that session by bills that eliminated a citizenship requirement for bartenders and made Susan B. Anthony’s birthday a special observance day in Wisconsin Schools; andWhereas, as Senate Majority leader, Tim was a champion for policies that improved the lives of everyday Wisconsinites, provided support to local municipalities, and protected consumers, workers, and both current and future homeowners; andWhereas, legislation authored by Senator Cullen that was enacted into law during his first six legislative sessions in the State Senate included improvements to state unemployment compensation laws, the creation of the Homeownership Mortgage Loan Program, increased payments to Wisconsinites claiming the homestead tax credit, better consumer protections for credit card holders, prohibiting felons from possessing firearms, and protections against sexual exploitation of children and the abuse of vulnerable adults; andWhereas, Tim’s advocacy for the people of the 15th State Senate District and all Wisconsinites was reflected in his legislative advocacy surrounding consumer protection, housing, agriculture, labor, transportation, conservation efforts, and government transparency; andWhereas, a sharp, shrewd leader and coalition builder, Tim’s great respect for his fellow caucus members and colleagues was reflected in the reputation he built within his own caucus and bonds forged across the aisle; andWhereas, Tim served the people of our state on a bipartisan basis as the Secretary of the Wisconsin Department of Health and Social Services in the cabinet of Republican Governor Tommy Thompson from 1987 to 1988; andWhereas, Tim began a twenty-year private sector career at Blue Cross Blue Shield in 1988; andWhereas, Tim returned to elected office by winning a seat on the Janesville School Board in 2007 and later winning election to another term in his former seat in the State Senate in 2010;

andWhereas, during this time, Tim was a fierce unapologetic advocate and champion for working families, union rights, collective bargaining and basic fairness to workers, and access to the ballot box; andWhereas, in 2011 Tim made a good-faith effort to negotiate with then-Governor Scott Walker’s office concerning the provisions in what would be 2011 Act 10 related to collective bargaining, underscoring his dedication to finding common ground and representing the interests of Wisconsin workers even in times of extreme partisanship; and   Whereas, many of Tim’s efforts, both as a public servant and private citizen, focused on attaining equal opportunities for all children, fighting for racial and gender equality, putting an end to partisan gerrymandering and maintaining open, accountable, and transparent state government; and   Whereas, during his return to the state legislature, Tim struck up a friendship and partnership with former Senate Majority Leader Dale Schultz, a Republican from Richland Center, who traveled the state with him for years urging the state to adopt nonpartisan redistricting and end gerrymandering; andWhereas, Tim’s lifelong commitment to serving his community and the State of Wisconsin included serving as a board member of Big Brothers of Janesville, the Janesville YMCA, the Les Aspin Center for Government, Everyone Cooperating to Help Others (ECHO), the Janesville Teacher Diversity Board, Forward Janesville, WisconsinEye, Common Cause in Wisconsin, and the Wisconsin Fair Elections Project; andWhereas, Tim founded the Tim Cullen Government Institute, allowing 11th graders to meet with state and local government leaders—making government more responsive and accessible and fostering the next generation of leaders; andWhereas, Tim authored three books sharing his insight and experience: “Ringside Seat: Wisconsin Politics, the 1970s to Scott Walker”; “Disassembled: A Native Son on Janesville and General Motors”; and “Wisconsin Gerrymandering: The Fight for Permanent Fair Maps and Why it Matters”; andWhereas, the proceeds from his published books benefit two programs that recognize the need for teachers of color in local school districts and encourage diverse students to become teachers—the Janesville Multicultural Teacher Scholarship Fund, which Tim started in 2008 and through which eleven participants of color have been hired and 20 students are currently in the pipeline to become teachers, and Beloit’s similar Grow Your Own Multicultural Teacher Scholarship Program; andWhereas, Tim will be remembered as an incredible husband to his late wife Barbara, a caring and dedicated father and grandfather, a devoted friend and mentor, and a beloved member of the Janesville community; andWhereas, Tim’s lifelong commitment to bipartisanship and good government, to fighting for the working class, and to improving the lives of all Wisconsinites will continue to have a positive impact on the Janesville community and the entire State of Wisconsin; now, therefore, be itResolved by the senate, the assembly concurring, That the members of the Wisconsin Legislature honor the life, legacy, and public service of Senator Tim Cullen and extend their deepest condolences to his family and friends, colleagues, and all those who knew him.

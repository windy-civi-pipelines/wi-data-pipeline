Referred to Committee on Government Operations, Labor and Economic Development.SB471,1,41An Act to repeal 108.04 (2) (bb) and 108.04 (2) (bd); to amend 108.04 (2) (a) 2(intro.) and 108.04 (2) (bm); to repeal and recreate 108.04 (2) (a) 3. and 3108.04 (2) (b) of the statutes; relating to: unemployment insurance work 4search and registration and granting rule-making authority.Analysis by the Legislative Reference BureauUnder current law, a claimant for unemployment insurance benefits is generally required to register for work and to conduct a work search for each week in order to remain eligible. Current law requires the Department of Workforce Development to waive these requirements under certain circumstances, for example, if a claimant who is laid off from work reasonably expects to be recalled to work within 12 weeks, will start a new job within four weeks, routinely obtains work through a labor union referral, or is participating in a training or work share program. Under current law, DWD may modify the statutory waivers or establish additional waivers by rule only if doing so is required or specifically allowed by federal law.This bill removes the waiver requirements from statute and instead allows DWD to establish waivers for the registration for work and work search requirements by rule. DWD may establish a waiver by emergency rule if the secretary of workforce development determines that the waiver is needed only on a temporary basis or that permanent rules are not warranted, and the bill allows the secretary to extend the emergency rule for up to 60 days at a time. Also, the bill specifies that the work search requirement does not apply to a claimant who has been laid off but DWD determines that the claimant has a reasonable expectation to be recalled to work.For further information see the state and local fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.The people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:SB471,11Section 1. 108.04 (2) (a) (intro.) of the statutes is amended to read:SB471,2,42108.04 (2) (a) (intro.)

(16) (am) 3and (b), and s. 108.062 (10) and (10m) and as otherwise expressly provided, a 4claimant is eligible for benefits as to any given week only if all of the following apply:SB471,25Section 2. 108.04 (2) (a) 3. of the statutes is repealed and recreated to read:SB471,3,26108.04 (2) (a) 3. The claimant conducts a reasonable search for suitable work 7during that week and provides verification of that search to the department. The 8search for suitable work must include at least 4 actions per week that constitute a 9reasonable search as prescribed by rule of the department. In addition, the 10department may, by rule, require a claimant to take more than 4 reasonable work 11search actions in any week. The department shall require a uniform number of 12reasonable work search actions for similar types of claimants. This subdivision 13does not apply to a claimant if the department determines that the claimant is 14currently laid off from employment with an employer but there is a reasonable 15expectation of reemployment of the individual by that employer. In determining 16whether the claimant has a reasonable expectation of reemployment by an 1employer, the department shall request the employer to verify the claimant’s 2employment status and shall consider all of the following:SB471,3,33a. The history of layoffs and reemployments by the employer.SB471,3,54b. Any information that the employer furnished to the claimant or the 5department concerning the claimant’s anticipated reemployment date.SB471,3,76c.

Notwithstanding s. 227.24 (1) (a) and (3), the 16department is not required to provide evidence that promulgating a rule under this 17subd. 2. a. as an emergency rule is necessary for the preservation of the public 18peace, health, safety, or welfare and is not required to provide a finding of 19emergency for a rule promulgated under this subd. 2. a. Except as provided under 20subd. 2. b., a rule promulgated under this subd. 2. a. remains in effect only for 150 21days.SB471,4,422b.

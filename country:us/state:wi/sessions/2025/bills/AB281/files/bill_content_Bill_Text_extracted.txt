With some exceptions, such purchases or contracts must be awarded to the lowest bidder.This bill creates a new exception to the lowest-bidder award by prohibiting the state from purchasing or contracting for materials or services with an employer that does not verify, by using the Federal Employment Eligibility Verification Program (E-Verify Program), that all of its employees are eligible to work in the United States or that employs an individual after the E-Verify Program identifies that the individual is not eligible to work in the United States.

Under current law, the supreme court’s disciplinary authority also extends to court commissioners. The Judicial Commission currently is charged with investigating alleged misconduct or permanent disability of a judge, justice, or court commissioner (judge). Under current law, if the Judicial Commission finds probable cause that a judge has engaged or is engaging in misconduct, it files a formal complaint with the supreme court, and, if the Judicial Commission finds probable cause that a judge has a permanent disability, it files a petition with the supreme court. Under current law, after a formal complaint or petition is filed, the supreme court may temporarily suspend a judge pending final determination of the proceedings. The supreme court ultimately determines the appropriate discipline or action in each proceeding.This bill specifies that, if the supreme court imposes a temporary suspension pending final determination of proceedings or imposes a suspension as a disciplinary sanction in a case of misconduct, the suspension must be without pay.The people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:AB380,11Section 1. 757.91 of the statutes is amended to read:AB380,2,82757.91 Supreme court; disposition.

Referred to Committee on Mental Health, Substance Abuse Prevention, Children and Families.SB163,1,41An Act to renumber and amend 767.58 (1); to amend 767.58 (2) and 767.59 2(3); to create 767.58 (1g), 767.58 (1r) (cm), 767.58 (3) and 767.58 (4) of the 3statutes; relating to: income change notifications for child support or 4maintenance orders.Analysis by the Legislative Reference BureauThis bill makes changes to the requirements for notice of a change of employer, address, and ability to pay for parties in child support and maintenance agreements.Under current law, the requirements for a notice of a change of employer, address, or ability to pay in child support and maintenance agreements apply only to payers of child support or maintenance. The bill extends these requirements to payees. The bill also specifies that the type of income for which a party must notify the other party of a change is defined by rule by the Department of Children and Families. DCF currently defines “gross income” for child support purposes to include a number of income sources, including wages and salaries, investment income, and certain benefits.The bill establishes that in an order for child support, but not maintenance, neither party is required to disclose income that is not considered gross income under DCF rules and the payee is not required to disclose a change in employer or income if the payer is not a “shared-placement parent,” as defined by DCF.The bill also removes references to “family support,” an alternative form of support that combined child support and maintenance into a single obligation. Orders for family support in this state were eliminated by 2021 Wisconsin Act 35.Finally, the bill allows a party to redact certain personally identifying information from an income change notice to another party, establishes the confidentiality of any information disclosed as part of an income change notice, and establishes that an individual who fails to provide an income change notice required under law may be proceeded against for contempt of court and may be required to provide damages, including reasonable attorney fees.The people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:SB163,11Section 1. 767.58 (1) of the statutes is renumbered 767.58 (1r), and 767.58 2(1r) (a), (b) and (c), as renumbered, are amended to read:SB163,2,63767.58 (1r) (a) Each order for child support, family support, or maintenance 4payments shall include an order that the payer and payee notify the county child 5support agency under s. 59.53 (5) of any change of address within 10 business days 6of the change.SB163,2,177(b) Each order for child support, family support, or maintenance payments 8shall also include an order that the payer and payee notify the county child support 9agency under s. 59.53 (5) and the payee other party, within 10 business days, of any 10change of employer and of any substantial change in the amount of his or her gross 11income, including receipt of bonus compensation as defined by rule by the 12department, affecting his or her ability to pay, or the amount of, child support, 13family support, or maintenance. The order shall also include a statement that 14notification of any substantial change in the amount of the payer’s party’s income 15will not result in a change of the order unless a revision of the order under s. 767.59 16or an annual adjustment of the child or family support amount under s. 767.553 is 17sought.SB163,3,31(c) Each order for family child support or maintenance payments shall include 2an order requiring the payee to notify the court and the payer within 10 business 3days of the payee’s remarriage.SB163,24Section 2. 767.58 (1g) of the statutes is created to read:SB163,3,85767.58 (1g) Definition.

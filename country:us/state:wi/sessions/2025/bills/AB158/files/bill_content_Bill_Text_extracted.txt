Also under current law, liability for such treatment for a mental injury is limited to no more than 32 weeks after the injury is first reported.Under current law, an injured emergency medical responder, emergency medical services practitioner, volunteer firefighter, correctional officer, emergency dispatcher, coroner, coroner staff member, medical examiner, or medical examiner staff member who does not have an accompanying physical injury must demonstrate a diagnosis based on unusual stress of greater dimensions than the day-to-day emotional strain and tension experienced by all employees as required under School District No. 1 v.

Under the bill, such an injured emergency medical responder, emergency medical services practitioner, volunteer firefighter, correctional officer, emergency dispatcher, coroner, coroner staff member, medical examiner, or medical examiner staff member is not required to demonstrate a diagnosis based on that standard, and instead must demonstrate a diagnosis based on the same standard as law enforcement officers and firefighters. Finally, under the bill, an emergency medical responder, emergency medical services practitioner, volunteer firefighter, correctional officer, emergency dispatcher, coroner, coroner staff member, medical examiner, or medical examiner staff member is restricted to compensation for a mental injury that is not accompanied by a physical injury and that results in a diagnosis of PTSD three times in his or her lifetime irrespective of a change of employer or employment in the same manner as law enforcement officers and firefighters.Because this bill relates to public employee retirement or pensions, it may be referred to the Joint Survey Committee on Retirement Systems for a report to be printed as an appendix to the bill.For further information see the state and local fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.The people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:AB158,11Section 1. 102.17 (9) (a) 1. of the statutes is renumbered 102.17 (9) (a) 1m. 2and amended to read:AB158,3,23102.17 (9) (a) 1m. “Fire fighter” “Firefighter” means any person employed on 4a full-time basis by the state or any political subdivision as a member or officer of a 1fire department, including the 1st class cities and state fire marshal and deputies 2or an individual who volunteers as a member or officer of such a department.AB158,23Section 2. 102.17 (9) (a) 1c. of the statutes is created to read:AB158,3,54102.17 (9) (a) 1c. “Correctional officer” has the meaning given in s. 102.475 5(8) (a).AB158,36Section 3. 102.17 (9) (a) 1e. of the statutes is created to read:AB158,3,87102.17 (9) (a) 1e. “Emergency medical responder” has the meaning given in s. 8256.01 (4p).AB158,49Section 4. 102.17 (9) (a) 1g. of the statutes is created to read:AB158,3,1110102.17 (9) (a) 1g. “Emergency medical services practitioner” has the meaning 11given in s. 256.01 (5).AB158,512Section 5. 102.17 (9) (a) 1p. of the statutes is created to read:AB158,3,1813102.17 (9) (a) 1p. “Medicolegal investigation staff member” includes a chief 14deputy coroner, a deputy coroner, a deputy medical examiner, and any individual 15who assists the office of a coroner or medical examiner with an investigation of a 16death. “Medicolegal investigation staff member” does not include an individual 17performing solely administrative functions in the office of a coroner or medical 18examiner.AB158,619Section 6. 102.17 (9) (b) (intro.) of the statutes is amended to read:AB158,4,420102.17 (9) (b) (intro.)

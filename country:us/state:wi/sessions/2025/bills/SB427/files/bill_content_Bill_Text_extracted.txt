Jacobson, Knodl, Mursau, Novak, O'Connor, Ortiz-Velez, Stubbs and Wichgers. Referred to Committee on Insurance, Housing, Rural Issues and Forestry.SB427,1,51An Act to amend 710.15 (1) (ad), 710.15 (1) (ag), 710.15 (1) (c), 710.15 (1) (d), 2710.15 (1) (f), 710.15 (1m), 710.15 (3) (a), 710.15 (5m) (f), 710.15 (5m) (g), 3710.15 (5m) (h), 710.15 (5m) (i), 710.15 (5m) (j) and 710.15 (5r); to create 4710.15 (1) (g), 710.15 (5m) (jm) and 710.15 (6) of the statutes; relating to: 5requirements for the rental of mobile and manufactured homes.Analysis by the Legislative Reference BureauCurrent law provides specific requirements relating to the rental of homes or sites in mobile or manufactured home communities. These requirements apply to “residents” (persons who rent a site in a mobile or manufactured home community and reside in a home on the site) and to “occupants” (persons who rent a home in a mobile or manufactured home community or who occupy a home on a rented site within the community).This bill changes the definitions of “resident” and “occupant,” thereby changing the persons to whom the existing requirements relating to rental of mobile and manufactured homes apply. Under the bill, “resident” is defined as a person who rents a site in a mobile or manufactured home community and who owns the home that is located on the site, regardless of whether the person resides there. “Occupant” is defined as a person other than a resident who resides in a mobile or manufactured home in a community with the home’s owner (the resident) with the consent of the community’s operator.The bill also provides that the requirements relating to rental of mobile and manufactured homes do not apply to a person who resides in a mobile or manufactured home without the home’s owner. Under the bill, a person who is not a resident or occupant who rents a mobile home or manufactured home from a resident or from the community’s operator is subject to current law governing landlords and tenants.In addition, the bill requires the owner or operator of a mobile or manufactured home community to provide at least 90 days’ written notice to all known residents and occupants before permanently retiring the community or a site within the community from the rental housing market. The bill also provides that, if a resident or occupant fails to sign and return a lease or lease renewal, the community operator may elect to hold the resident or occupant on a month-to-month lease.Under current law, the tenancy of a resident or occupant may be terminated only for specific reasons. Under current law, such a tenancy may be terminated based on a resident’s or occupant’s refusal to sign a lease; under the bill, a tenancy may also be terminated for failing to submit a signed lease to the community’s operator. Under current law, a tenancy may be terminated for a material misrepresentation in the application for tenancy; under the bill a tenancy may also be terminated for failure to meet any nondiscriminatory application criteria. In addition, the bill provides that a tenancy may be terminated for violating a community rule prohibiting any resident from owning more than one home in the community.Finally, the bill changes the definition of “community.” Under current law, a “community” is defined as a tract of land with at least three plots upon which mobile homes or manufactured homes are located in exchange for rent or other fees. Under the bill, “community” is defined as any plot with at least three occupied mobile homes or manufactured homes, with an exception for certain farms.For further information see the state fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.The people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:SB427,11Section 1. 710.15 (1) (ad) of the statutes is amended to read:SB427,3,62710.15 (1) (ad) “Community” means a tract of land containing 3 or more plots 3of ground upon which mobile homes or manufactured homes are located in 4exchange for the payment of rent or any other fee pursuant to a lease any plot or 1plots of ground upon which 3 or more mobile homes or manufactured homes that 2are occupied for dwelling or sleeping purposes are located. “Community” does not 3include a farm where the occupants of the mobile homes or manufactured homes 4are the father, mother, son, daughter, brother, or sister of the farm owner or 5operator or where the occupants of the mobile homes or manufactured homes work 6on the farm.SB427,27Section 2. 710.15 (1) (ag) of the statutes is amended to read:SB427,3,118710.15 (1) (ag) “Lease” means a written agreement between an operator and 9a resident or occupant establishing the terms upon which the mobile home or 10manufactured home may be located in the community or the resident or occupant 11may occupy a mobile home or manufactured home in the community.SB427,312Section 3. 710.15 (1) (c) of the statutes is amended to read:SB427,3,1713710.15 (1) (c) “Occupant” means a person other than a resident who rents a 14mobile home or manufactured home in a community from an operator or who 15occupies, as his or her residence, a mobile home or manufactured home located on a 16plot of ground that is rented in a community from an operator site, together with a 17resident of the mobile home or manufactured home, with the operator’s consent.SB427,418Section 4. 710.15 (1) (d) of the statutes is amended to read:SB427,3,2219710.15 (1) (d) “Operator” means a person engaged in the business of renting 20plots of ground sites or mobile homes or manufactured homes in a community to 21mobile home or manufactured home owners or residents, occupants, or tenants who 22are not residents or occupants.SB427,523Section 5. 710.15 (1) (f) of the statutes is amended to read:SB427,4,41710.15 (1) (f) “Resident” means a person who rents a mobile home or 2manufactured home site in a community from an operator and who occupies owns 3the mobile home or site as his or her residence manufactured home located on the 4site.SB427,65Section 6. 710.15 (1) (g) of the statutes is created to read:SB427,4,76710.15 (1) (g) “Site” means a plot of ground in a community upon which a 7mobile home or manufactured home is located.SB427,78Section 7. 710.15 (1m) of the statutes is amended to read:SB427,4,149710.15 (1m) Requirement and term of lease.

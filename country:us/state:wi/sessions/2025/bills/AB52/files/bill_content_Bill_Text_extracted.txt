Jacobson, Joers, Johnson, Kirsch, Madison, Mayadev, McCarville, Moore Omokunde, Neubauer, Ortiz-Velez, Palmeri, Phelps, Prado, McGuire, Rivera-Wagner, Roe, Sheehan, Sinicki, Snodgrass, Spaude, Stroud, Stubbs, Subeck, Taylor, Tenorio, Udell and Vining, cosponsored by Senators Spreitzer, L. Johnson, Dassler-Alfheim, Wall, Carpenter, Drake, Habush Sinykin, Hesselbein, Keyeski, Larson, Ratcliff, Roys, Pfaff, Smith and Wirch. Referred to Committee on Ways and Means.AB52,1,41An Act to repeal 71.54 (1) (g) 5. and 71.54 (1) (g) 7.; to amend 71.54 (1) (g) 2(intro.), 71.54 (1) (g) 4., 71.54 (1) (g) 6.

The credit is based on the claimant’s household income and the amount of property taxes or rent constituting property taxes on his or her Wisconsin homestead. Because the credit is refundable, if the credit exceeds the claimant’s income tax liability, he or she receives the excess as a refund check. Under current law, there are three key dollar amounts used when calculating the credit:1. If household income is $8,060 or less, the credit is 80 percent of the property taxes or rent constituting property taxes. If household income exceeds $8,060, the property taxes or rent constituting property taxes are reduced by 8.785 percent of the household income exceeding $8,060, and the credit is 80 percent of the reduced property taxes or rent constituting property taxes.2. The credit may not be claimed if household income exceeds $24,680.3. The maximum property taxes or rent constituting property taxes used to calculate the credit is $1,460.Beginning with claims filed for the 2025 tax year, this bill reduces the percentage used for household income over $8,060 from 8.785 to 5.614 percent and increases the maximum income amount from $24,680 to $35,000. The bill also indexes the $8,060, $35,000, and $1,460 amounts for inflation during future tax years.For further information see the state fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.The people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:AB52,11Section 1. 71.54 (1) (g) (intro.) of the statutes is amended to read:AB52,2,4271.54 (1) (g) 2012 and thereafter to 2025.

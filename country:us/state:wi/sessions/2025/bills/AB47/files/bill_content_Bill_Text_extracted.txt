(intro.); to create 36.27 (3n) (a) 1r. of the statutes; relating to: tuition 6and fee remission for certain veterans and their dependents enrolled in the 7University of Wisconsin System or a technical college.Analysis by the Legislative Reference BureauThis bill modifies the residency requirement for the tuition and fee remission program for certain veterans and their spouses and children enrolled in University of Wisconsin System schools and technical colleges.Under current law, if certain criteria are met, veterans and their spouses and 17- to 25-year-old children are eligible for full remission of tuition and fees at UW System schools and technical colleges for up to eight semesters or 128 credits, whichever is longer. Under the veterans fee remission program, the veteran must be a resident of this state when he or she entered military service or be a resident of this state for at least five consecutive years immediately before the veteran registers at a UW System school or technical college. Under the fee remission program for the spouse or child of a veteran who suffered service-connected death or disability, the veteran must have been a resident of this state when he or she entered military service or one of the following must apply: 1) if the veteran, while a resident of this state, died on active duty, died as the result of a service-connected disability, or died in the line of duty while on active or inactive duty for training purposes, the veteran must have resided in this state for at least five consecutive years while an adult, or 2) if the veteran received at least a 30 percent service-connected disability rating, the veteran must have resided in this state for at least five consecutive years immediately before the veteran’s spouse or child registers at a UW System school or technical college. In addition, if a veteran was not a resident of this state when he or she entered military service, the veteran’s spouse or child is eligible for tuition and fee remission only if the spouse or child has resided in this state for at least five consecutive years immediately before the spouse’s or child’s enrollment in a UW System school or technical college.This bill eliminates the five-year durational residency requirement for veterans and their spouses and children under the tuition and fee remission program under circumstances in which the veteran was not a resident of this state when he or she entered military service. Under the bill, if the veteran was not a resident of this state when he or she entered military service, the veteran is still eligible for the tuition and fee remission program if the veteran is a resident of this state immediately before the veteran registers at a UW System school or technical college. Also under the bill, if the veteran was not a resident of this state when he or she entered military service, the veteran’s spouse and children are still eligible for the tuition and fee remission program if the spouse or child resided in this state immediately before the spouse or child registers at a UW System school or technical college and if the veteran, as described in 1), above, resided in this state at any time while an adult or the veteran, as described in 2), above, resided in this state immediately before the veteran’s spouse or child registers at a UW System school or technical college. If the applicable requirements for fee remission are met, the veteran or the veteran’s spouse or child is eligible for fee remission regardless of whether the veteran or veteran’s spouse or child would otherwise qualify as a resident student for tuition or fee purposes.For further information see the state and local fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.The people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:AB47,11Section 1. 36.27 (3n) (a) 1m. a. of the statutes is amended to read:AB47,3,7236.27 (3n) (a) 1m. a.

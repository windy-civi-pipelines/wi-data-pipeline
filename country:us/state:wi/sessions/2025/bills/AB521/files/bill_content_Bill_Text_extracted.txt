Jacobson, Knodl, Melotik, Mursau, Penterman, Spiros, Steffen, Tucker, Wichgers and Doyle, cosponsored by Senators Tomczyk, Jacque, Nass and Wanggaard.

DOT must provide for the care, protection, and maintenance of trees and other roadside vegetation, including cutting, trimming, or removing trees and other vegetation as needed to provide safety to highway users. Current law generally prohibits a person from cutting, trimming, removing, or planting a tree or other vegetation within the right-of-way of a state trunk highway, including interstate highways, without DOT’s consent.Under current law, outdoor advertising signs (signs) viewable from a highway are regulated and subject to an annual permit fee payable to DOT (sign permit). A sign owner may also apply for a permit from DOT that authorizes the owner to maintain and remove vegetation obstructing the view of the owner’s sign along a state trunk highway, including an interstate highway (vegetation removal permit).Under current law, a vegetation removal permit authorizes sign owners to trim or remove vegetation approved by DOT for removal within a sign’s “viewing zone,” which is the final 1,000 feet along the highway when approaching a sign. The bill defines a “viewing window,” which is the final 500 feet of the viewing zone. Under the bill, a sign owner with a vegetation removal permit may clear cut all vegetation within a sign’s viewing window, including vegetation located in the median of a divided highway.Under current law, a vegetation removal permit holder that removes trees with a diameter of two inches or more must compensate DOT for the removed trees. The bill eliminates the requirement that an arborist be employed and provides that compensation is due only if the trees were removed from a living snow fence. The bill defines “living snow fence” to mean vegetation that functions as a berm or barrier to inhibit the accumulation of snow on the highway during the winter season that is planted by the department in a highway right-of-way and the location of which is documented by the department. The bill increases the amount of compensation from $200 to $300 per tree and requires DOT to use the amounts collected to plant living snow fences.Finally, the bill provides that a sign owner who was issued a vegetation removal permit on or after May 19, 2012, is not required to apply for subsequent permits for the same sign and may remove vegetation in the sign’s viewing window without additional approval or supervision by DOT. The sign owner must notify DOT prior to removal of any vegetation and must provide DOT with photographs of the sign site before and after the vegetation removal is completed.For further information see the state fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.The people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:AB521,11Section 1. 84.305 (1) (ar) of the statutes is created to read:AB521,2,5284.305 (1) (ar) “Living snow fence” means vegetation that functions as a berm 3or barrier to inhibit the accumulation of snow on the highway during the winter 4season that is planted by the department in a highway right-of-way and the location 5of which is documented by the department.AB521,26Section 2. 84.305 (1) (hm) of the statutes is created to read:AB521,3,7184.305 (1) (hm) “Viewing window” means, with respect to a sign, the area in 2which vegetation removal is authorized by permit within the viewing zone for the 3sign, extending on the main-traveled way of the highway nearest the sign for the 4direction of travel for which the sign face is oriented and extending, in the direction 5opposite of the direction of travel of the main-traveled way from which the sign face 6is visible and intended to be viewed, in a line along the highway pavement edge for 7a distance of 500 continuous feet.AB521,38Section 3. 84.305 (2) of the statutes is amended to read:AB521,3,15984.305 (2) Notwithstanding ss. 66.1037 and 86.03, and subject to sub. subs. 10(2m) and (3r), upon application, the department shall issue permits to sign owners 11for the trimming or removal of vegetation that is located in the right-of-way of a 12highway under the jurisdiction of the department for maintenance purposes and 13that obstructs a sign if, within a distance of 500 continuous feet along any portion of 14the viewing zone, any portion of the face of the sign is not viewable because of an 15obstruction to sight by vegetation in the highway right-of-way.AB521,416Section 4. 84.305 (2m) (a) of the statutes is repealed.AB521,517Section 5. 84.305 (2m) (ar) of the statutes is created to read:AB521,3,191884.305 (2m) (ar) A person may apply for a permit under this section for new 19sign locations prior to the construction of the sign.AB521,620Section 6. 84.305 (3) (a) of the statutes is amended to read:AB521,4,22184.305 (3) (a) Subject to pars.

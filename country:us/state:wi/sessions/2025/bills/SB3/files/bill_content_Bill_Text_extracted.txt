Referred to Committee on Utilities and Tourism.SB3,1,41An Act to amend 66.0401 (1m) (intro.); to create 66.0401 (1r), 66.0401 (4) (h), 2196.49 (4m) and 196.491 (3) (d) 9. of the statutes; relating to: requiring local 3approval for certain wind and solar projects before Public Service Commission 4approval.Analysis by the Legislative Reference BureauCurrent law prohibits a person from beginning construction of a large electric generating facility (LEGF) unless the Public Service Commission grants a certificate of public convenience and necessity (CPCN) for the proposed facility. An LEGF is defined as a facility with a nominal operating capacity of 100 megawatts or more. In addition, a public utility may not engage in certain construction, expansion, or other projects unless PSC grants a certificate of authority (CA) for the proposed project. The bill defines a “solar project” and “wind project” as an area of land on which, respectively, solar photovoltaic panels or devices used for collecting wind energy, along with any associated equipment and facilities, are installed in order to generate electricity and which altogether is designed for nominal operation at a capacity of 15 megawatts or more.Under this bill, before PSC may approve a CA or a CPCN for the construction of a solar project or wind project, the person seeking the certificate must seek approval from each city, village, and town in which the solar project or wind project is to be located. The bill requires a city, village, or town to approve or disapprove a proposed solar project or wind project by adopting a resolution to that effect no later than 90 days after receiving a request for such approval. If the city, village, or town fails to act within that time period, the project is considered approved. The bill allows this deadline to be extended for certain reasons. Current law limits the authority of political subdivisions to regulate solar and wind energy systems, allowing political subdivisions to impose restrictions only if they meet certain conditions. The bill provides that those limitations do not apply to the approval or disapproval of a solar project or a wind project by a city, town, or village. Current law also imposes procedures for political subdivisions that receive applications for approval relating to wind energy systems. Those procedures do not apply to approval or disapproval of a wind project under the bill.Under the bill, PSC may not issue a CPCN or CA for a solar project or wind project unless each city, village, and town in which the project is proposed to be located has adopted a resolution approving the project.The people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:SB3,11Section 1. 66.0401 (1m) (intro.) of the statutes is amended to read:SB3,2,9266.0401 (1m) Authority to restrict systems limited.

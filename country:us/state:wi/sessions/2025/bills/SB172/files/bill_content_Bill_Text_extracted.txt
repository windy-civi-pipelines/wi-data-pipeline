If the owner prevails in the action, the court must order the real estate released from the effect of the document and may award actual damages, costs, and reasonable attorney fees.Because this bill creates a new crime or revises a penalty for an existing crime, the Joint Review Committee on Criminal Penalties may be requested to prepare a report.For further information see the local fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.The people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:SB172,11Section 1. 59.43 (1c) (intro.) of the statutes is amended to read:SB172,2,3259.43 (1c) Register of deeds; duties.

Referred to Committee on Universities and Technical Colleges.SB581,1,31An Act to repeal 36.09 (3m); to amend 36.09 (4), 36.09 (4m) and 36.09 (5) of 2the statutes; relating to: shared governance at University of Wisconsin 3System institutions.Analysis by the Legislative Reference BureauThis bill modifies statutory provisions relating to shared governance at University of Wisconsin System institutions to restore these provisions to their form just prior to enactment of the 2015-17 biennial budget act (2015 Wisconsin Act 55).Current law, after 2015 Wisconsin Act 55, specifies the division of responsibilities at UW System institutions as follows: 1) the chancellors are the executive heads and are vested with the responsibility of administering the policies of the Board of Regents and, in consultation with the faculty, carrying out other policy-related responsibilities such as designing curricula, setting degree requirements, determining academic standards, establishing standards for faculty appointment and promotion, and administering institutional funds; 2) the faculty of each institution has the primary responsibility for advising the chancellor regarding academic and educational activities and faculty personnel matters; 3) the academic staff of each institution has the primary responsibility for advising the chancellor regarding the formulation and review, and must be represented in the development, of policies and procedures concerning academic staff, including academic staff personnel matters; and 4) the students of each institution have the primary responsibility for advising the chancellor regarding the formulation and review of policies concerning student life, services, and interests. However, this authority of the faculty, academic staff, and students is subordinate to the authority of the Board of Regents, the UW System president, and the chancellor, and the authority of the academic staff and students is further subordinate to the authority of the faculty. Although faculty have the right to determine their own organizational structure and to select their representatives in institutional governance, they must ensure that faculty in academic disciplines related to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) are adequately represented in the faculty organizational structure.Before 2015 Wisconsin Act 55, the division of responsibilities applicable to faculty, academic staff, and students at UW System institutions was characterized as follows: 1) the faculty was vested with responsibility for the immediate governance of the institution and had to actively participate in institutional policy development, and as such had the primary responsibility for academic and educational activities and faculty personnel matters; 2) the academic staff had to be active participants in the immediate governance of and policy development for the institution and had the primary responsibility for the formulation and review, and had to be represented in the development, of all policies and procedures concerning academic staff members, including academic staff personnel matters; and 3) the students had to be active participants in the immediate governance of and policy development for the institution and, as such, had primary responsibility for the formulation and review of policies concerning student life, services and interests. However, these responsibilities of the faculty, academic staff, and students were subject to the responsibilities and powers of the Board of Regents, the UW System president, and the chancellor, and the responsibilities of the academic staff and students were further subject to the responsibilities of the faculty. In addition, prior to 2015 Wisconsin Act 55, there was no statutory requirement that STEM faculty be adequately represented in the faculty organizational structure.This bill restores provisions relating to shared governance at UW System institutions to the form in which they existed just prior to the enactment of 2015 Wisconsin Act 55.The people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:SB581,11Section 1. 36.09 (3m) of the statutes is repealed.SB581,22Section 2. 36.09 (4) of the statutes is amended to read:SB581,3,10336.09 (4) Faculty. The faculty of each institution, subject to the 1responsibilities and powers of the board, the president, and the chancellor of such 2institution, shall be vested with responsibility for the immediate governance of such 3institution and shall actively participate in institutional policy development. As 4such, the faculty shall have the primary responsibility for advising the chancellor 5regarding academic and educational activities and faculty personnel matters. The 6faculty of each institution shall have the right to determine their own faculty 7organizational structure and to select representatives to participate in institutional 8governance, except that the faculty of each institution shall ensure that faculty in 9academic disciplines related to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics 10are adequately represented in the faculty organizational structure.SB581,311Section 3. 36.09 (4m) of the statutes is amended to read:SB581,3,211236.09 (4m) Academic staff. The academic staff members of each institution, 13subject to the responsibilities and powers of the board, the president, the chancellor, 14and the faculty of the institution, shall be active participants in the immediate 15governance of and policy development for the institution. The academic staff 16members have the primary responsibility for advising the chancellor regarding the 17formulation and review, and shall be represented in the development, of all policies 18and procedures concerning academic staff members, including academic staff 19personnel matters. The academic staff members of each institution shall have the 20right to organize themselves in a manner they determine and to select their 21representatives to participate in institutional governance.SB581,422Section 4. 36.09 (5) of the statutes is amended to read:SB581,4,102336.09 (5) Students. The students of each institution or campus subject to the 1responsibilities and powers of the board, the president, the chancellor, and the 2faculty shall be active participants in the immediate governance of and policy 3development for such institutions. As such, students shall have primary 4responsibility for advising the chancellor regarding the formulation and review of 5policies concerning student life, services, and interests. Students in consultation 6with the chancellor and subject to the final confirmation of the board shall have the 7responsibility for the disposition of those student fees which constitute substantial 8support for campus student activities. The students of each institution or campus 9shall have the right to organize themselves in a manner they determine and to 10select their representatives to participate in institutional governance.SB581,4,1111(end) Down Down /2025/related/proposals/sb581 true proposaltext /2025/related/proposals/sb581 proposaltext/2025/REG/SB581 proposaltext/2025/REG/SB581 section true Menu»2025»Related Documents»Proposal Text»SB581: Bill Text × Details for PDF view Link (Permanent link) Bookmark this location View toggle Go to top of document Search in this chapter Search in this section Search in this agency Search in this chapter group Search in this chapter Search in this section Cross references for section Acts affecting this section References to this 1970 Statutes Annotations Appellate Court Citations Administrative Code Index Reference lines Clear highlighting

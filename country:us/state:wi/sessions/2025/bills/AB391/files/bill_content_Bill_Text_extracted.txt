(intro.) of the statutes; relating to: the per pupil 3adjustment for school district revenue limits.Analysis by the Legislative Reference BureauCurrent law generally limits the total amount of revenue per pupil that a school district may receive from general school aids and property taxes in a school year to the amount of revenue allowed per pupil in the previous school year plus a per pupil adjustment, if any, as provided by law. Current law, which was upheld in LeMieux v. Evers, 2025 WI 12, provides an annual $325 per pupil adjustment until 2425.This bill eliminates the $325 per pupil adjustment in the school district revenue limit formula beginning with the calculation of school district revenue limits for the 2027-28 school year. As a result, there is no per pupil adjustment in school district revenue limit calculations for the 2027-28 school year and any school year thereafter.For further information see the local fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.The people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:AB391,11Section 1. 121.905 (3) (c) 6. of the statutes is amended to read:AB391,2,42121.905 (3) (c) 6.

Under the bill, an employee who alleges that he or she has been injured by being subjected to an abusive work environment or by being subjected to retaliation or a threat of retaliation for opposing an abusive work environment or for initiating, or in any manner participating in, an investigation, action, or proceeding to enforce the right not to be subjected to an abusive work environment (“unlawful employment practice”) may bring an action in circuit court against the employer or employee who allegedly engaged in the unlawful employment practice for relief the court considers appropriate. The aggrieved employee must commence an action within one year after the last act constituting the unlawful employment practice occurred.If the circuit court finds that an employer or employee has engaged in an unlawful employment practice, the court may enjoin the employer or employee from engaging in that practice and may grant other relief the court considers appropriate, including reinstatement of the aggrieved employee, removal of the person who engaged in the abusive conduct from the aggrieved employee’s work area, medical expenses, back pay, front pay, compensation for pain and suffering, compensation for emotional distress, punitive damages, and reasonable costs and attorney fees. If the circuit court orders payment of money because of an unlawful employment practice engaged in by an employee, the employer of the employee is liable for that payment. If an employer is found to have engaged in an unlawful employment practice that did not result in an adverse employment action against the aggrieved employee, the employer is not liable for compensation for emotional distress or punitive damages unless the abusive conduct was extreme and outrageous.For further information see the state fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.The people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:SB460,11Section 1. 102.03 (2) of the statutes is amended to read:SB460,2,122102.03 (2) Where such Except as provided in this subsection, when those 3conditions exist the right to the recovery of compensation under this chapter shall 4be the exclusive remedy against the employer, any other employee of the same 5employer, and the worker’s compensation insurance carrier.

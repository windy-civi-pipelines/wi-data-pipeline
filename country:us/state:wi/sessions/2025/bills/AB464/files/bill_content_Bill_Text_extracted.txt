Projects subject to the bill include state and local projects of public works, including state highway projects, with exceptions including projects below certain cost thresholds, minor service or maintenance work, and certain residential projects. Under the bill, “prevailing wage rate” is defined as the hourly basic rate of pay, plus the hourly contribution for bona fide economic benefits, paid for a majority of the hours worked in a trade or occupation in the area in which the project is located, except that, if there is no rate at which a majority of those hours is paid, “prevailing wage rate” means the average hourly basic rate of pay, plus the average hourly contribution for bona fide economic benefits, paid for the highest-paid 51 percent of hours worked in a trade or occupation in the area. “Prevailing hours of labor” is defined as 10 hours per day and 40 hours per week, excluding weekends and holidays. The bill requires the Department of Workforce Development to conduct investigations and hold public hearings as necessary to define the trades or occupations that are commonly employed on projects that are subject to the prevailing wage law and to inform itself of the prevailing wage rates in all areas of the state for those trades or occupations, in order to determine the prevailing wage rate for each trade or occupation. The bill contains certain other provisions regarding the calculation of prevailing wage rates by DWD, including provisions allowing persons to request recalculations or reviews of the prevailing wage rates determined by DWD.The bill requires contracts and notices for bids for projects subject to the bill to include and incorporate provisions ensuring compliance with the requirements. The bill also establishes a requirement that state agencies and local governments post prevailing wage rates and hours of labor in areas readily accessible to persons employed on the project or in sites regularly used for posting notices.The bill makes a contractor that fails to pay the prevailing wage rate or overtime pay to an employee as required under the prevailing wage law liable to the affected employee for not only the amount of unpaid wages and overtime pay, but also for liquidated damages in an amount equal to 100 percent of the unpaid wages and overtime pay.Finally, the bill includes, for both state and local projects of public works, provisions regarding coverage, compliance, enforcement, and penalties, including 1) requirements for affidavits to be filed by contractors affirming compliance with the prevailing wage law; 2) record retention requirements for contractors regarding wages paid to workers and provisions allowing for the inspection of those records by DWD; 3) liability and penalty provisions for certain violations, including criminal penalties; and 4) provisions prohibiting contracts from being awarded to persons who have failed to comply with the prevailing wage law.Transportation projectsUnder current law, for certain highway projects for which the Department of Transportation spends federal money, federal money must make up at least 70 percent of the funding for those projects. DOT is required to notify political subdivisions receiving aid for local projects whether the aid includes federal moneys and how those moneys must be spent. For certain projects that receive no federal money, DOT may not require political subdivisions to comply with any portion of DOT’s facilities development manual other than design standards. Any local project funded with state funds under the surface transportation program or the local bridge program must be let through competitive bidding and by contract to the lowest responsible bidder. The bill repeals all of these requirements.Because this bill creates a new crime or revises a penalty for an existing crime, the Joint Review Committee on Criminal Penalties may be requested to prepare a report.For further information see the state and local fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.The people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:AB464,11Section 1. 19.36 (12) of the statutes is created to read:AB464,2,11219.36 (12) Information relating to certain employees.

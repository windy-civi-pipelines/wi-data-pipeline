Referred to Committee on Campaigns and Elections.AJR1,1,21To create section 1m of article III of the constitution; relating to: requiring 2photographic identification to vote in any election (second consideration).Analysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau EXPLANATION OF PROPOSAL This proposed constitutional amendment, to be given second consideration by the 2025 legislature for submittal to the voters in April 2025, was first considered by the 2023 legislature in 2023 Senate Joint Resolution 73, which became 2023 Enrolled Joint Resolution 9.This constitutional amendment provides that a qualified elector may not vote in any election unless the elector presents photographic identification issued by this state, by the federal government, by a federally recognized American Indian tribe or band in this state, or by a college or university in this state, that verifies the elector’s identity. Acceptable forms of photographic identification must be specified by law. The amendment authorizes the legislature to pass laws establishing exceptions to the photographic identification requirement. Additionally, if an elector is unable to present valid photographic identification before voting on election day, the elector must be given the opportunity to cast a provisional ballot and present valid photographic identification at a later time and place, as provided by law. PROCEDURE FOR SECOND CONSIDERATION When a proposed constitutional amendment is before the legislature on second consideration, any change in the text approved by the preceding legislature causes the proposed constitutional amendment to revert to first consideration status so that second consideration approval would have to be given by the next legislature before the proposal may be submitted to the people for ratification [see joint rule 57 (2)].   If the legislature approves a proposed constitutional amendment on second consideration, it must also set the date for submitting the proposed constitutional amendment to the people for ratification and must determine the question or questions to appear on the ballot.AJR1,2,41Whereas, the 2023 legislature in regular session considered a proposed 2amendment to the constitution in 2023 Senate Joint Resolution 73, which became 32023 Enrolled Joint Resolution 9, and agreed to it by a majority of the members 4elected to each of the two houses, which proposed amendment reads as follows:AJR1,1Section 1.

The legislature shall by law establish acceptable forms of photographic identification, and the legislature may by law establish exceptions to the requirement under this subsection.(2) A qualified elector who is unable to present valid photographic identification on election day shall be permitted to cast a provisional ballot. A provisional ballot may not be counted unless the elector presents valid photographic identification at a later time and place as provided by the legislature by law.AJR1,2Section 2.

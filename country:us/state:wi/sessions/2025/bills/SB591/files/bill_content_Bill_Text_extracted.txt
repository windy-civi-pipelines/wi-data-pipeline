Referred to Committee on Universities and Technical Colleges.SB591,1,71An Act to amend 36.11 (3) (b), 36.11 (3) (cm) 5., 36.31 (2m) (b), 36.31 (2m) (c), 236.31 (2m) (d), 36.65 (3), 38.12 (14) (a) 1., 38.12 (14) (a) 3., 38.12 (14) (c), 38.12 3(14) (d), subchapter I (title) of chapter 106 [precedes 106.001], 118.55 (3) (a), 4118.55 (3) (b), 118.55 (5) (e) 1. and 118.55 (8) (a); to create 15.227 (16), 36.31 5(2m) (bm) and 106.08 of the statutes; relating to: dual enrollment programs, 6creating the Council on Dual Enrollment, and transfer of postsecondary 7course credits.Analysis by the Legislative Reference BureauThis bill creates the Council on Dual Enrollment (council) in the Department of Workforce Development. The council consists of two members appointed by the president of the University of Wisconsin System; two members appointed by the director of the Wisconsin Technical College System; two members appointed by the state superintendent of public instruction; two members appointed by the president of the Wisconsin Association of Independent Colleges and Universities (WAICU); one member appointed by the executive director of the Wisconsin Association of School Boards; one member appointed by the board of directors of the Wisconsin Council of Religious and Independent Schools; one member who represents tribal colleges in this state; one member who is a school district administrator appointed by the Joint Committee on Legislative Organization; one member appointed by the speaker of the assembly; and one member appointed by the senate majority leader. The bill defines a “dual enrollment program” as any program or course of study designed to provide high school pupils with the opportunity to gain credits in both high school and a UW System institution, technical college, private nonprofit college, or tribal college in Wisconsin (institution of higher education). The council must study and recommend methods of ensuring that all Wisconsin pupils and their families have access to clear, affordable, and attainable pathways to college credit during high school. The council must also endeavor to maximize the acceptance by institutions of higher education of course credit earned in high school. The council must advise DWD with respect to all of the council’s findings and recommendations. The council must meet at least annually to review and make recommendations regarding the state’s dual enrollment programs. DWD must provide administrative support and assistance to the council.The bill requires DWD to establish and maintain a portal on DWD’s website dedicated to informing high school pupils and their families about the state’s dual enrollment programs. As part of the information available on the portal, DWD must include 1) sufficient information for pupils and their families to apply to any dual enrollment program offered in Wisconsin and 2) information regarding courses that may be taken under dual enrollment programs offered in Wisconsin. DWD must update this information at least annually. DWD must also post on the portal the council’s findings and recommendations from each annual review. In addition, DWD must create a printed brochure that includes, at a minimum, the information specified in items 1) and 2) above, and this brochure must be available to high school pupils and their families and to school staff.Current law provides various options for high school pupils to receive postsecondary credit through dual enrollment programs. These options include contractual partnerships between institutions of higher education and high school governing bodies as well as programs known as the Early College Credit Program (ECCP) and the Start College Now Program (SCNP).Currently under ECCP, a pupil attending a public high school, including a charter school, or a private high school may enroll in a UW System institution, private nonprofit college, or tribal college to take one or more courses, including during a summer session. The pupil must submit an application to the applicable postsecondary institution and indicate on the application whether the pupil will be taking each course for high school credit or postsecondary credit or both. A pupil who intends to enroll in a postsecondary institution under ECCP must notify the governing body of the pupil’s high school by March 1 if the pupil intends to enroll in the fall semester and by October 1 if the pupil intends to enroll in the spring semester. The notice must include certain information, such as each course title and whether the pupil will take the course for high school or postsecondary credit. If the course is to be taken for high school credit, the governing body of the pupil’s high school must determine whether the course is comparable to a course offered and whether the course satisfies high school graduation requirements. A postsecondary institution must admit a pupil to attend a course under ECCP if the pupil meets the requirements and prerequisites of the course and there is space available in the course. If a postsecondary institution admits a pupil to ECCP, it must notify the governing body of the pupil’s high school. Responsibility for payment of tuition and fees for a course taken under ECCP depends on various factors, but the cost may be borne by the governing body of the pupil’s high school, DWD, or the pupil or a combination of these. However, the pupil generally pays nothing if the course is taken for high school credit and postsecondary credit and there is no comparable high school course available to the pupil.Currently under SCNP, a public school pupil may apply to attend a technical college to take one or more courses if the pupil satisfies certain criteria, including that the pupil 1) has completed the 10th grade; 2) is in good academic standing; and 3) notifies the applicable school board of the pupil’s intent to attend a technical college under SCNP by March 1 if the pupil intends to enroll in the fall semester and by October 1 if the pupil intends to enroll in the spring semester. Subject to exceptions, the technical college must admit the pupil if the pupil meets the requirements and prerequisites of the course and there is space available in the course. The pupil is eligible to receive both high school and technical college credit for courses successfully completed at the technical college. If the course is not comparable to courses offered in the pupil’s school district, the school district must pay the pupil’s tuition and fees for the course.The bill makes the following changes to ECCP and SCNP:1. It allows summer session courses to be taken under SCNP.2. It changes the applicable deadline for a pupil to give notice of intent to take a course under either program from March 1 to May 1 for the fall semester and from October 1 to November 1 for the spring semester. It also establishes a notice deadline of April 1 for a summer session.3. It allows 9th and 10th grade pupils to take courses under SCNP.Current law requires each school board to annually provide information about ECCP to all pupils enrolled in the school district in the 8th, 9th, 10th, and 11th grades. The bill requires this information to also be provided to pupils in the 7th grade. The bill also requires the school board to provide, from the DWD portal, sufficient information for parents and students to apply to any dual enrollment program offered in Wisconsin.Current law requires the Board of Regents to establish policies for the transfer of course credits between UW System institutions, including postsecondary credits earned by a high school pupil under ECCP. By September 1, 2026, all credits for core general education courses must be transferable between UW System institutions and satisfy general education requirements at the receiving institution. The Board of Regents may also establish policies for the transfer of course credits with other educational institutions, including postsecondary credits earned under ECCP. In addition, the Board of Regents and the WTCS Board must enter into an agreement that identifies at least 72 credits of core general education courses that are transferable and satisfy general education requirements at the receiving UW institution or technical college. The Board of Regents and the WTCS Board must ensure that tribal colleges and WAICU, on behalf of private nonprofit colleges, have an opportunity to participate in the agreement.The bill requires the Board of Regents and WAICU, on behalf of private nonprofit colleges, to enter into an agreement that identifies at least 36 credits of core general education courses that are transferable and satisfy general education requirements at the receiving UW institution or at the receiving private college that chooses to participate in the agreement. A private college may exclude from application of the agreement any course that does not align with an institutional religious or professional pathway requirement.The bill also specifies that, if core general education course credits are transferable under current law, postsecondary credits earned by a high school pupil under ECCP or SCNP for completion of a core general education course are likewise transferable.For further information see the state and local fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.The people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:SB591,11Section 1. 15.227 (16) of the statutes is created to read:SB591,2,4215.227 (16) Council on dual enrollment.

The council consists of two members appointed by the president of the University of Wisconsin System; two members appointed by the director of the Wisconsin Technical College System; two members appointed by the state superintendent of public instruction; two members appointed by the president of the Wisconsin Association of Independent Colleges and Universities (WAICU); one member appointed by the executive director of the Wisconsin Association of School Boards; one member appointed by the board of directors of the Wisconsin Council of Religious and Independent Schools; one member who represents tribal colleges in this state; one member who is a school district administrator appointed by the Joint Committee on Legislative Organization; one member appointed by the speaker of the assembly; and one member appointed by the senate majority leader. The bill defines a “dual enrollment program” as any program or course of study designed to provide high school pupils with the opportunity to gain credits in both high school and a UW System institution, technical college, private nonprofit college, or tribal college in Wisconsin (institution of higher education). The council must study and recommend methods of ensuring that all Wisconsin pupils and their families have access to clear, affordable, and attainable pathways to college credit during high school. The council must also endeavor to maximize the acceptance by institutions of higher education of course credit earned in high school. The council must advise DWD with respect to all of the council’s findings and recommendations. The council must meet at least annually to review and make recommendations regarding the state’s dual enrollment programs. DWD must provide administrative support and assistance to the council.The bill requires DWD to establish and maintain a portal on DWD’s website dedicated to informing high school pupils and their families about the state’s dual enrollment programs. As part of the information available on the portal, DWD must include 1) sufficient information for pupils and their families to apply to any dual enrollment program offered in Wisconsin and 2) information regarding courses that may be taken under dual enrollment programs offered in Wisconsin. DWD must update this information at least annually. DWD must also post on the portal the council’s findings and recommendations from each annual review. In addition, DWD must create a printed brochure that includes, at a minimum, the information specified in items 1) and 2) above, and this brochure must be available to high school pupils and their families and to school staff.Current law provides various options for high school pupils to receive postsecondary credit through dual enrollment programs. These options include contractual partnerships between institutions of higher education and high school governing bodies as well as programs known as the Early College Credit Program (ECCP) and the Start College Now Program (SCNP).Currently under ECCP, a pupil attending a public high school, including a charter school, or a private high school may enroll in a UW System institution, private nonprofit college, or tribal college to take one or more courses, including during a summer session. The pupil must submit an application to the applicable postsecondary institution and indicate on the application whether the pupil will be taking each course for high school credit or postsecondary credit or both. A pupil who intends to enroll in a postsecondary institution under ECCP must notify the governing body of the pupil’s high school by March 1 if the pupil intends to enroll in the fall semester and by October 1 if the pupil intends to enroll in the spring semester. The notice must include certain information, such as each course title and whether the pupil will take the course for high school or postsecondary credit. If the course is to be taken for high school credit, the governing body of the pupil’s high school must determine whether the course is comparable to a course offered and whether the course satisfies high school graduation requirements. A postsecondary institution must admit a pupil to attend a course under ECCP if the pupil meets the requirements and prerequisites of the course and there is space available in the course. If a postsecondary institution admits a pupil to ECCP, it must notify the governing body of the pupil’s high school. Responsibility for payment of tuition and fees for a course taken under ECCP depends on various factors, but the cost may be borne by the governing body of the pupil’s high school, DWD, or the pupil or a combination of these. However, the pupil generally pays nothing if the course is taken for high school credit and postsecondary credit and there is no comparable high school course available to the pupil.Currently under SCNP, a public school pupil may apply to attend a technical college to take one or more courses if the pupil satisfies certain criteria, including that the pupil 1) has completed the 10th grade; 2) is in good academic standing; and 3) notifies the applicable school board of the pupil’s intent to attend a technical college under SCNP by March 1 if the pupil intends to enroll in the fall semester and by October 1 if the pupil intends to enroll in the spring semester. Subject to exceptions, the technical college must admit the pupil if the pupil meets the requirements and prerequisites of the course and there is space available in the course. The pupil is eligible to receive both high school and technical college credit for courses successfully completed at the technical college. If the course is not comparable to courses offered in the pupil’s school district, the school district must pay the pupil’s tuition and fees for the course.The bill makes the following changes to ECCP and SCNP:1. It allows summer session courses to be taken under SCNP.2. It changes the applicable deadline for a pupil to give notice of intent to take a course under either program from March 1 to May 1 for the fall semester and from October 1 to November 1 for the spring semester. It also establishes a notice deadline of April 1 for a summer session.3. It allows 9th and 10th grade pupils to take courses under SCNP.Current law requires each school board to annually provide information about ECCP to all pupils enrolled in the school district in the 8th, 9th, 10th, and 11th grades. The bill requires this information to also be provided to pupils in the 7th grade. The bill also requires the school board to provide, from the DWD portal, sufficient information for parents and students to apply to any dual enrollment program offered in Wisconsin.Current law requires the Board of Regents to establish policies for the transfer of course credits between UW System institutions, including postsecondary credits earned by a high school pupil under ECCP. By September 1, 2026, all credits for core general education courses must be transferable between UW System institutions and satisfy general education requirements at the receiving institution. The Board of Regents may also establish policies for the transfer of course credits with other educational institutions, including postsecondary credits earned under ECCP. In addition, the Board of Regents and the WTCS Board must enter into an agreement that identifies at least 72 credits of core general education courses that are transferable and satisfy general education requirements at the receiving UW institution or technical college. The Board of Regents and the WTCS Board must ensure that tribal colleges and WAICU, on behalf of private nonprofit colleges, have an opportunity to participate in the agreement.The bill requires the Board of Regents and WAICU, on behalf of private nonprofit colleges, to enter into an agreement that identifies at least 36 credits of core general education courses that are transferable and satisfy general education requirements at the receiving UW institution or at the receiving private college that chooses to participate in the agreement. A private college may exclude from application of the agreement any course that does not align with an institutional religious or professional pathway requirement.The bill also specifies that, if core general education course credits are transferable under current law, postsecondary credits earned by a high school pupil under ECCP or SCNP for completion of a core general education course are likewise transferable.For further information see the state and local fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.The people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:SB591,11Section 1. 15.227 (16) of the statutes is created to read:SB591,2,4215.227 (16) Council on dual enrollment.

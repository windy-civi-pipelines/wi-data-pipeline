This bill expands the prohibition to include what are known as “deep fakes.” The bill provides that it is a Class I felony to post, publish, distribute, or exhibit a synthetic intimate representation (commonly known as a “deep fake”) of an identifiable person with intent to coerce, harass, or intimidate that person. Under the bill, a synthetic intimate representation is defined as a representation generated using technological means that uses an identifiable person’s face, likeness, or other distinguishing characteristic to depict an intimate representation of that person, regardless of whether the representation includes components that are artificial, legally generated, or generally accessible.Under current law, it is a Class A misdemeanor to publish or post a private representation, which is a sexually explicit representation that is intended by the person depicted in the representation to be possessed or viewed only by the persons with whom it was directly shared, without consent of the person depicted. This bill provides that it is also a Class A misdemeanor to reproduce such representations without that person’s consent.Because this bill creates a new crime or revises a penalty for an existing crime, the Joint Review Committee on Criminal Penalties may be requested to prepare a report.The people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:AB33,11Section 1. 942.09 (1) (e) of the statutes is created to read:AB33,2,62942.09 (1) (e) “Synthetic intimate representation” means a representation 3generated using technological means that uses an identifiable person’s face, 4likeness, or other distinguishing characteristic to depict an intimate representation 5of that person, regardless of whether the representation includes components that 6are artificial, legally generated, or generally accessible.AB33,27Section 2. 942.09 (2) (am) 4. of the statutes is created to read:AB33,2,108942.09 (2) (am) 4.
